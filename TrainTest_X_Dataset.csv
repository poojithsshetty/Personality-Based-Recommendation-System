The service was efficient, the room had all the necessary comforts, and the large outdoor swimming pool (big enough for proper length training if you are so inclined) is a particular bonus.

998,2093,Hotels,7/7/2013,Favourite little hotel in Melbourne,"This is a repeat review and about the 4th time I&acute;ve stayed here.  It&acute;s always tough when going to Melbourne whether to stay here, because I really like it, or whether to stay at one of the Hyatt&acute;s where I am part of the guest program and my work gets a discount. I split it 50-50 if on business, but always opt to stay here if on leisure (and will be doing so later this month).  It really is a delightful hotel; impeccably clean; very comfortable rooms; great mini-bar (especially the giant freckles!); fantastic coffee shop; nice restaurant; well-located right on the tram line into the city; and some lovely &acute;added extra&acute; touches.

1024,2093,Hotels,6/28/2012,Really enjoyable!,"I had an enjoyable two nights at The Blackman. The room was really comfortable and spacious; it was spotlessly clean; the bed was good (but a bit soft); and the place just has a nice feel about it. Like another reviewer here, the staff were variable but even the less than friendly ones were efficient (other than at breakfast - see below). I particularly loved the Smart Car hire on the hour - very handy, and much cheaper than a taxi. The bistro/restaurant is worthy of a mention: the fresh fish meals I had were both delicious and, of course, the location is one of the nicest areas in Melbourne.  It was a bit overwhelming with a conference or workshop on both days, with attendees swarming all over the breakfast rooms at the same time and taking up the lifts. In fact, the breakfast was one of the big drawbacks. I made the mistake of going to the small coffee shop instead of the bistro: it was slow (took 20 minutes just for the order to be taken), understaffed and, after 40 minutes more waiting, I couldn&acute;t wait any longer for my bread and jam and had to leave.",5,1,101,Art Series - The Blackman,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255100-d1528419-Reviews-Art_Series_The_Blackman-Melbourne_Victoria.html,Melbourne,0

592,1NicePerson,Hotels,6/3/2014,Continuing to Improve,"I can finally report that cleanliness here is getting a lot of attention. My room was cleaned very well each day, including the bathroom. The grounds and pool are also cleaned to a high standard. Of course this property is about 60 years old and is constantly in need of maintenance. For the price they charge, the upkeep is impressive. John and Chris are great owners and the other staff are also very nice. It&acute;s nice to find a place with a theme such as this that cares about and doesn&acute;t exploit its guests. Of course, while there is action possible here, many guests just come to relax so it&acute;s not quite as active as some of the competitor rip-off resorts. That&acute;s probably a good thing. Breakfast is OK but if you&acute;re looking for fresh squeezed juice and omelets made to order, you&acute;ll have go to a $200 a night resort. Here you get cold cereals, frozen OJ, decent coffee, hard boiled eggs and store bought pastries, bagels and muffins. It all works for me - just like home. And being able to walk to downtown or take the 111 bus is a big plus for the Canyon Club.

The housekeeper not only changes the towels and empties the trash but actually cleans the room, every day! John and Chris are very hospitable and James is friendly and polite to a fault.

Breakfast has improved over the years with an immense variety including do-it-yourself smoothies, cereals, hard boiled eggs, pastries, etc. etc. Very nice.

18142,COCOFromOttawa,Hotels,3/23/2015,WooHoo! Our Best Trip Yet!,"This is our fourth spring break vacation at Club Med Sandpiper Bay. Once again, we had a great active break, with everyone in our extended family ready to rebook for next year. I&acute;ve left some tips for anyone planning a vacation there followed by a few comments for management, below. But first, a shout out to the folks that keep us coming back. A big highlight of our trip this year were daily tennis lessons with Dennis and Gino - their great advice and entertaining classes got us back in shape and ready to hit the court again. We took the beginner lessons because we hadn&acute;t played in a few years. The fun effective drills and Gino&acute;s teaching style were hilarious. In the restaurant, Michael and servers Will, Tiffany and Justine were fantastic. The chefs are the hardest working of all ... magnificent job Chefs! Head of Sports Jake with Casey and Hunter on land and James and Emily on the water all do a great job. Golf pros Mikes (there are two) and John&acute;s clinics were excellent as always. Great to see Lionel back!  I gave yoga another shot (see comment below). Everyone sailed (some took lessons) and swam, some power walked and used the well equipped gym, and our teen boys played volleyball, basketball, touch football and ping pong daily.  Some tips: don&acute;t expect four or even five star accommodation. The magic here is in the many activities and the spirit of the GOs (Gentilles Organisateurs or entertainers) who work long hours to keep guest busy, happy and relaxed. Golf and tennis are the main sports priorities with excellent staff dedicated to both. This is not a romantic couples get away though there are lots of chances to steal away to the adult pool or sail or play tennis together when the kids are in the mini club or as in our case, busy in sports. The resort is on a river; the small beach is best for water sports like sailing and paddle boarding. We&acute;ve seen jelly fish, small sharks and on this trip briefly, a four foot long alligator in the bay. (Another, with a taste for tennis players lives behind the back tennis courts 17-20). Transfers from the airport are pricey. While this used to buy you a ride in a stretch limo or luxury vehicle, now it could also mean a ride in a van with 2 other families - you can rent a car or SUV for a week for the same price or much less - this will also let you make quick trips to the nearby towns of Stuart and Jensen and the (gorgeous) beaches for swimming or surfing only 20 minutes by car. Food at the resort is mainly a buffet ... With tons of choice, much of it very healthy with not too large portion sizes which I really appreciate (you can always ask for more). There&acute;s soft serve ice cream hidden in the mini club dining area of the main restaurant. There are also two sit down restaurants one informal and the other more formal, both with limited menus and much less interesting than the buffet. The main goal ofthe formal restaurant is to up sell you on some very overpriced wine. Reserve a table for a large group early. The spa is a real gem. The massage therapists are magicians. This is a great way to jump start that wonderful I&acute;m-on-vacation feeling. Word from some locals is that the resort will be renovated next year a good thing (some think it will be sold).. Wifi is $50 per week per device. Even with the surcharge, it&acute;s slow and unreliable. Shows are fun - our faves were The Gatsby show and the rockin&acute; Music factory show Saturday night.  For resort management: we saw a huge improvement in room cleanliness and condition over last year, all of our group&acute;s rooms were well maintained and clean. Almost all of the kitchen and restaurant glitches have been fixed and the restaurants ran smoothly even with 1000 guests in residence (though lots fell apart in the restaurant the day Michael was off - that guy deserves a medal for his work ethic and dedication to customer service). Scheduling and communications glitches were minimal. One very big suggestion: once again, yoga was truly abysmal and would have been laughable if it hadn&acute;t been so unsafe. Please, I beg you find some trained yoga teachers.",5,5,105,Club Med Sandpiper Bay,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34580-d219076-Reviews-Club_Med_Sandpiper_Bay-Port_Saint_Lucie_Florida.html,Port Saint Lucie,0
18163,COCOFromOttawa,Hotels,3/24/2013,"Active, Healthy ... Revitalizing Family Holiday","A week at Sandpiper Bay is a wonderful way to revive yourself at the end of a long, cold Northern winter. This is the place to come to be active and healthy again, bringing normalcy back to an achy body that&acute;s been too long at a desk or traipsing through airports. That&acute;s the way I felt when my recent Sandpiper-week started. But now, as I&acute;m ready to leave, I feel invigorated by quality time with my husband and kids, sunshine, daily power walks, yoga and weights. Not to mention a vast array of delicious health foods. (Don&acute;t get me wrong, there are LOTS of ways to indulge too). Plus tons of sports and other activities - organized and drop-in - for every kid and adult. Note though that this is definitely and mainly a family resort. This is not an ideal destination at school holiday peak times if you&acute;re a couple or single looking for quiet romance or to party. Like all of the properties in the Club Med portfolio, you&acute;ll like Sandpiper most if you want to be active and are not seeking particularly luxurious accommodations - rooms are nice, beds comfy, bathrooms are basic - the real strengths of Sandpiper though are the G.O. s (staff hosts and animators) and the many activities. Highlights .. And some shout outs to the hardworking G.Os who made our trip extraordinary. The new Chef Du Village, Jeff is always present and approachable. The Land Sports team nailed the mix of genial host and leadership that made the many sports events they led through the week the reason my kids are begging us to come back again soon. Thanks to the ever energetic and hospitable Jake - sure to be a Chef Du Village someday - and to the very genial born-leaders Andrew and Hunter. Golf staff are extremely welcoming and professional, thanks in large measure to Joey and Nate. Golf clinics every morning with Bruce, Michael and David are of very high caliber and sure to knock a few shots off even the most accomplished golfers&acute; handicap. Finally, I am deeply grateful to Micha - you taught me that I CAN practice yoga (every day!) and I now I see how beneficial it can be. Your sessions did wonders for me. The chef - always close by at mealtimes - deserves a great deal of credit as does his hard working team who seem to work round the clock to deliver fresh baked bread, fresh fish, creative salads and a wide variety of cuisines as well as gorgeous desserts for all tastes. It was easy to avoid gluten at every meal. Judging from the comments of other guests, the beef wellington was a near religious experience and I can confirm that the roast duck and lamb were amazing. For guests: Don&acute;t let the buffet style meals turn you off. The food here is consistently extremely good. We noticed many of last years&acute; glitches were fixed . The coffee is great now. Latitude for 11 to 17 year olds is now properly supervised and divided by age group. Check in and out run smoothly. We appreciated the snacks prepared for our late arrival. The gym is comprehensive and inviting and clean. A few suggestions for improvement: I missed the tennis academy demonstration. Sometimes scheduling glitches remain and silverware and wine glass shortages are common at mealtime. It would be worthwhile to fully open Soleil to Marketplace diners at lunch and dinner. Although this is an option some nights, guests were squeezing past tropical plants and climbing rope barriers to get to the buffet. Bar staff seem overworked, a bit bored and in need of a new assignment. Sandpiper, youre missing an important opportunity to be a model of integration with and support to the rather fragile, but fascinating river-front ecosystem that surrounds the resort property. Thanks for a great time Sandpiper Bay.

977,2093,Hotels,10/17/2013,Second time around,"This is our second stay at Eden Rock, 2.5 years after our first. The first time we stayed for 10 nights, this time around for 6 nights - so that should say something about how much we enjoy it.  If you&acute;re looking for the hustle and bustle of the Old City, you won&acute;t find it here. There&acute;s no cobblestone streets, centuries old buildings and hordes of people.  But the Old City is only 15 minutes away by bus, or less by car. We use it as a base not only to get-to-know and explore Firenze, but the surrounding countryside of Tuscany, including Umbria and Chianti and to the coast.  Eden Rock is a contemporary renovation of an establishment built in the 1950s into a wonderful location on the side of a rock in the hills to the north of Florence. It has a gorgeous picture postcard view across to the other hill of Fiesole and down the valley to the Duomo and old city - of itself, this is enough to instill a sense of calm and tranquility. The suites are comfortable, have everything you need (perhaps a microwave would be helpful) and are of high quality without being over-the-top. The breakfast is balanced. While a limited menu - which is understandable - the in-house lunch/dining was surprisingly very good and tasty on the one occasion we used it.  But most of all, what brought us back is the people. Led by Daniele, who is wonderful, and including Walter, Sylvia & others, the staff are friendly, warm, efficient and helpful.

It was fantastico! Not only is it a lovely place to stay with gorgeous views across to Fiesole and towards the city, but the helpfulness and friendliness of the team at Eden Rock is unparalleled. I particularly have to note Daniele who gave great advice and tips on where to go, itineraries and places to eat but was also so patient in showing us the best way to navigate through the streets of Firenze (especially as we drive on the opposite side of the road!). The apartment we stayed in was very comfortable and was a mini home-away-from-home. The property has beautiful gardens and is very well maintained and it was a just a great place to be for the end of what was a wonderful 4 week holiday for us. To top it off, the breakfast room and breakfasts were also delightful and thanks to Sylvia for her beautiful brioches!  Finally, we had the fun of seeing Fiorentina defeat Udinese 5-2 in a Serie A match. Once again, Daniele kindly took us with him to the game and returned us.

Rooms and hallways are cleaned corner to corner and there is no chipped paint or stained carpets here. Everything is looked after and it shows. Staff if great and breakfast is always tasty and well maintained. Only two issues take away from being a perfect hotel. The desks are placed in front of the air conditioning units so you have your choice of turning off the A/C and sweltering or getting a cold blast of air on your shoulder. This is common in many hotels - not sure why. Perhaps an air diverter would solve the problem. Secondly, this hotel has the slowest elevator in Florida. There is only one and it serves both guests and housekeepers (with their carts) and it is slow. The door opens slowly, the door closes slowly, the elevator move slowly. The entrances fromt the parking areas are in the center of the building yet the only two stairways are at the extreme ends. So you have a choice of walking half the length of the building to the stairway, or using the one slow elevator. Really not a good design at all.

Location is good too, being about a 10 minute walk from Taksim Square with lots of retauarants, shops and ATMs nearby. Be advised, however that internet access is rather expensive and the mini-bar prices are the highest I have seen anywhere. At 16TL (~USD13) for a beer, you should think twice before taking one (or visit the Executive Lounge). All in all, this is a top notch hotel and I would certainly stay there again if I return to Istanbul.",5,1,101,Hampton Inn Ft.

It&acute;s interesting on the outside but when we ducked inside to get out of the wind, we discovered that it&acute;s far more special on the inside. One could easily spend and hour or more walking around photographing this place.  The architecture is a visual treat and when you add in the fact that it has a cafe and a couple of shops to browse, something as seemingly mundane as a convention center becomes a worthwhile tourist attraction.

5265,Aelwyn,Attractions,5/28/2015,Fascinating Place,"Highgate is the crown jewel of the Magnificent Seven in my opinion. It is wonderfully interesting both historically and as a place to explore. The tour of the West cemetery is excellent and gives one a lot of history of the site as a whole plus it is the only way to view some of the more unusual aspects of the place. Do be aware that some places are off limits to photography which is unfortunate because those are the places I wanted to shoot most.  The East side is available to wander for as long as one wishes and it could easily be many hours in good weather. The sculptural headstones are rich with verse and information from a bygone time and the tilted, overgrown stones have such storybook character that everyone can find a strange beauty there and a connection to the past.  I look forward to visiting again. Oh and one word of advice... wellies.

Downside is the leisure club,we used the pool , it was smaller than pictures portray and grubby.The changing rooms are so small there was 4 people in and they were full the lockers we broken too.The gym areas looked more modern but very small.The steam room was dark and smelly and we couldnt use the sauna due to some disrespectful guests laying full out on the benches and making no attempt to move,therefore leaving no space.But thats not the hotels fault.Another downside is the bathrooms!! So small, literally one person only,even then you have to move to close door, and the bath was tiny, deffo no full sized at all.However,these down points are not deal breakers for us.I loved this hotel.",5,0,100,Hilton Blackpool Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186332-d192735-Reviews-Hilton_Blackpool_Hotel-Blackpool_Lancashire_England.html,Blackpool,0

11561,Badgerjim,Hotels,4/5/2014,A terrific experience,"One of the good things about picking a hotel in New York City is that you have a huge array of options. If you&acute;re someone who has $500 a night to burn on an old classic hotel with a gigantic lobby and rooms the size of a basketball court, there are other places where you can do that. But for what I needed on this trip, it is hard to imagine a better value than what I got. For openers, by New York standards the price was very, very reasonable. The room, while quite small, had an exceptionally comfortable bed, was immaculately clean (well, the outside windows were kind of dirty, but this is Manhattan), had an excellent TV with a fine choice of channels, good water pressure and hot water and overall very well maintained. The public areas, including the stairs, were very clean as well. It is true that the breakfast area was crowded, but I never was unable to get a seat, and I enjoyed the cinnamon rolls others have mentioned. The location is interesting: it&acute;s farther from restaurants and the subway than other Manhattan hotels where I&acute;ve stayed, but within a 10 minute walk, you have plenty of choices. What&acute;s more, the neighborhood is astonishingly quiet and restful for Manhattan, and felt much safer and in better shape than I remembered Hell&acute;s Kitchen being. I was concerned about staying west of 7th Avenue, but I need not have been--the neighborhood is just fine. It&acute;s also a fine location for a walk to see a show (I walked right up 48th to the Walter Kerr Theater) or the Intrepid Museum. So for these reasons alone, the hotel would rate a strong review from me. What pushes it up to five circles was the service. I can&acute;t remember the last time I stayed at a hotel *anywhere* that had service this good. Staff remembered that I was there to see an NIT basketball game with my alma mater Minnesota at Madison Square Garden, and asked me later how the game went. Several of them remembered who I was, including the excellent housekeeper Fabiola. When there was a small plumbing problem in my room, it was fixed within 15 minutes. The manager who you see in the comments after other reviews was a regular presence at breakfast, checking up on how people were. They also gave me a room upgrade when I let them know I was in the Holiday Inn guest card program. I appreciate enthusiastic people who do a good job, whether it&acute;s in a hotel or somewhere else. This hotel has created a culture where the staff are committed to doing just that. I&acute;d gladly stay there again.",5,0,100,Holiday Inn Express New York - Manhattan West Side,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d3572583-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_New_York_Manhattan_West_Side-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,0

Very comfortable, clean and quite room. There is a keen attention to detail here, not many missed stiches, everything is in its place. The breakfast is well prepared and satisfying. They even provide two types of regular coffee, one is stronger.  Could it improve? Yes, some minor improvements would make it even better, the exercise room is small and has no elliptical machine, but surely was adequate. Oddly, there were no washcloths in my room.

The hotel very clean and the room was great (tho &acute;only&acute; a double bed in the suite, rather than a king as in the other rooms - not a problem, as I was on my own for work). My one and only quibble (and this is general to many hotels) is that the curtains in the bedroom area didn&acute;t fully close / cover the windows.

In addition there are so many sun beds around the pool and the top floor that there is no issue with finding one.

The room was a good size, with a large bathroom and was well equipped with both a refrigerator and a slim line TV. Both breakfast and the evening meal are &acute;buffet style&acute; and provide a wide range of foods. Breakfast offered a range of fresh fruit and cereal, together with the usual cooked offerings as well as individually cooked omelettes. Likewise the evening meal had an excellent array of salads, along with a good choice of hot meals. Desserts were also excellent. During our stay guests did not &acute;book&acute; sunbeds in the early morning as there were more than enough for everybody. The rooftop sun terrace is a suntrap; the double sun beds are very comfortable! During the evenings, Matt and Sarah offered some superb entertainment; the best we have seen in any hotel/resort of this type. As other reviewers have noted, the hotel is on a hill and the walk back from Funchal can be tiring but if you are reasonably fit, you can return from the town centre in 20 minutes.

5311,Aelwyn,Attractions,6/29/2013,A Must-Do... But Don&acute;t Stop at the Top of the Funicular!,"I read suggestions online from Bergen residents regarding hiking the peaks around the city. These hikes are definitely some of the highlights of a visit to Norway&acute;s second largest city.  Most tourists flock to the funicular, ride it to the top, take their photos from the elevated viewpoint and ride back down. This is the best way to completely miss the beauty of the region. Even a short hike will quickly reveal lakes, water falls, and gorgeous vistas which make the initial view pale in comparison. The mossy forests look like something right out of Middle Earth and should not be missed. It&acute;s easy to see where the popular local troll legends come from as the mountainous woodland certainly does feel magical.  Trail maps are available at the tourist office and hikes range from quite easy to exhaustingly difficult.  The easy hikes will take you to lakes and and gentle spots to relax and take in the scenery and get a feel for this magical area and still allow you to make it back to the cafe for lunch.  The moderate and hard hikes ranging from 4-8 hours will take you up and away from the crowds. You&acute;ll venture above the tree line, see World War Two batteries, cross bridges and dams, visit numerous ancient ruins and see magnificent views about which only tiniest fraction of the funicular riders even know.  The funicular and the view from Mount Floyen are a don&acute;t miss"""" but don&acute;t stop there... the train ride and the observation platform are only the doorway to the majesty of the mountains surrounding Bergen.""""",5,3,103,Mount Floyen and the Funicular (Floibanen),http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190502-d246101-Reviews-Mount_Floyen_and_the_Funicular_Floibanen-Bergen_Hordaland_Western_Norway.html,Bergen,0
24309,DBSA42,Attractions,3/22/2014,Well Worth the Visit,"We first went to the centre two years ago as part of an organised tour of Barbados. This time, we decided to try and arrange the visit ourselves, and the experience was well worth the effort. Having checked on the tour times, we caught the local yellow reggae bus (an amazing experience in itself) to the main bus station in Bridgetown (2 Barbados$ for any length of a single trip) At the bus station, we changed to a number 4 mini bus (again 2$ Barbados) We asked to be put of at the visitor centre and only had to walk a matter of 100 meters or so. The tour of the centre is fantastic and costs $20 Barbados (??6+). You get to see a film of the process of making the rum, a guided tour of the antiquities at the centre, a look at the bottling plant and best of all, a tasting session where several of the strengths are tasted and the process and time of distilling is described. After the tour, you can visit their gift shop and buy Mount Gay rum at a very reasonable cost, go to their own bar and taste more rum (at a small charge) There is also a cafe/terrace where you can order food. We thought retracing our steps to Bridgetown would be difficult, so we asked the gateman to order a taxi for us, to get us back to the hotel.

It has a large Thyme restaurant which is open till late and serves breakfast from 5.30 if you have an early flight. There is also a 24 hour Costa coffee. The reception, bar and restaurant facilities are in a long atrium area which looks very stylish and has lots of chairs and tables and a lively atmosphere. There are just three floors of rooms arranged along long corridors and the standard is typical Premier Inn. Our room was large and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities, an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, a full length mirror and a dressing table, good lighting, easy heating/AC controls and a safe. We arrived at about 8 pm having driven down from Yorkshire and there were still some spaces in the car park (the website had warned that parking could be limited and it is charged at ??10 for 24 hours) By the way - if you are going on holiday from Heathrow and you book with Purple Parking - this hotel is right next door to the car park. We often stay at Premier Inns and are invariably impressed by their staff training. This hotel was no exception. I was on crutches having broken my ankle, so the receptionist asked me if we would prefer a room close to the lift as the room we had been allocated was a long way down the corridor. She phoned housekeeping and changed our room number with the minimum of fuss. There is nothing negative to say about this excellent hotel but the biggest positive for me was the superb soundproofing. Planes are leaving and arriving very close to the hotel and it was very busy but we heard nothing at all inside our room and we had a perfect night&acute;s sleep.

It&acute;s hard for me to recognise the place from some of the bad reviews here.  The restaurant is located in a dedicated restaurant street and many customers walk in without booking. When unexpectedly busy, the service can be slowish (and where is not slower when busy?) but it has never been other than efficient and polite and mostly warm and friendly. The food has always been very good and sometimes quite outstanding. Besides the a la carte menu, there is a blackboard with competitively priced table d&acute;hote menus.

The food was the usual well cooked and presented, reasonably priced and sometimes quite imaginative menu expected from previous visits. The service was friendly and competent until near the end when they struggled to keep up with the demand.

On our first night at dinner we where allocated a table of our choice and where told by reception that it would be our table for our whole 2 week stay,but the downside to this was the maitre D wanted you too see him every night on entry and you had to give your room no and the no of your tabel,this caused long queues in the evening which was the only downside to the evening meal experience!! The food could not be faulted at all,plenty of choice and really was something for all tastes,though if your a veggie,then this is not the place for you,as there is an abundance of meat and we did see and altercation,between a guest who was veggie and the maitre D on a couple of evenings,but to his credit,he did seem to make sure that the chefs cooked him something!! Breakfast was a more laid back affair as its served between 8-11am so didnt seem crowded at anytime!! Fresh Bacon and eggs anyway you like cooked by carlos to order and the usual continental style meats and cheeses and fruit etc. The coffee is quite strong and if you like your cappuchinos with plenty of chocolate,then youll be in heaven,i prefered more milk with mine so make sure you order caffe con leche from the machine!!. The maids where wonderfull and changed the towels each day and the beds once a week and it didnt take them long either,ours was done on most occasions whilst we where at breakfast!! The location is Excellent,right next to the yumbo so all your nightlife right on your doorstep with a special gateway which you can access with your room key,which leads into the yumbo!! Weather was hot,most days in the high 80s and only one day of rain,which we where told was highly unusual for the time of year,rooms air conditioned though so the heat wasnt a problem if your not into sunbathing at the pool!! We never stayed in the hotel during the day as we like to get out around gran canaria,but one of our fave spots melonares which is a 4 euro 10 mins taxi ride away,its right by the sea with a promanade and some wonderfull bars etc.and some real good designer shops,great for people watching and a lazy drink relaxin by the sea. We went with thomas cook and for the most part they where good,though the resort rep was not as good,she didnt seem at all interested in telling everyone what the island had to offer,though as it was our 5th visit to the island that didnt bother us too much. Lots of different nationals staying on our visit,but quite a high percentage of germans and English,and would say it was 70% gay and didnt encounter any homophobic comments etc when we stayed.

17227,Burnleyguy,Hotels,7/15/2014,Should be 4 star,"Stayed here between the 30th of june and the 14th of july,(2 weeks)  Location.  Superb for all the nightlife in the yumbo centre and great if you want to use public transport.Breach is around a 15 min walk down the road,but who would want to sunbathe there when around the pool at this hotel is much better!!  Rooms  Just recently refurbished and we had room 406 which was overlooking the pool,very nicely decorated and spacious with flat screen tv and twin beds which are comfortable and can be placed together for those intimate moments!!. Bathroom very spacious too with a great shower which is hot and powerfull,just what you need after a hot day in the sun.  Food  Brilliant choice of foods each evening and on many nights a BBQ which consisted of usually 2 meats and some veg,veal was very popular on many nights cooked in various styles but if thats not for you then no need to worry as there is always plenty of choice with a great selection of salads,meats,rice,veg etc!! Nice selection of sweets too and for the cheese and biscuit lover there was always a nice selection! Breakfast was a nice affair too with some decent bacon,plenty of eggs,boiled/scrambled/fried,sausages where usually the frankfurter variety but hey it didnt worry us in the slightest!!  Staff  Very very friendly and always aknowledge you,special praise for the staff around the outside bar and the waiting staff in the restuarant!! Our maid was brilliant and if you needed anything she was only too willing to oblige!!  Prices  We though the prices here for food and drinks where cheap and superb value for money so if your on a tight budget you neednt worry to much and you most certainly wont be ripped off!!!  Wi-fi  Didnt use it but from all accounts its not that good,instead use the many free wi-fi spots around the bars in the yumbo,worked a treat for us!!  All in All we had a briliant time here and we will certainly return,one of the best value holidays we have had in a while!!!!!  For the best room ask for pool views and a high floor,we could just see the sea from our room too!!",5,4,104,Hotel Riu Don Miguel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562819-d237083-Reviews-Hotel_Riu_Don_Miguel-Playa_del_Ingles_Gran_Canaria_Canary_Islands.html,Playa del Ingles,2
25342,Danglebone,Hotels,6/25/2014,Yet another faultless stay,"6th or 7th stay, this time for a 2 day visit as a Platinum Ambassador, upgraded to a Spa Suite with a view of Wellington Arch and a huge bathroom also with a view - very unusual for London. Everywhere is spotlessly clean and every member of staff is polite without exception, always a Good Morning or Good Afternoon.  This time the room came with access to the club lounge, which I would recommend, again the staff here are exceptional and the view is quite unique in London - Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Big Ben, The Eye, The Shard, etc etc. A fantastic location for an evening drink.

25344,Danglebone,Hotels,6/20/2013,Another excellent stay,"Fourth or fifth visit, every time all staff the doormen, the check in staff, house keeping are friendly and helpful, even staff walking along corridors going about their work greet you. This stay on points - upgraded to room 870 on the 8th floor, which initially we thought was an odd shape, but it worked fine, it had a huge terrace with table and chairs which we were able to enjoy in the evening and it provided a first class view of the aeroplane flyovers and Red Arrows during the Trooping of the Colour weekend.  As usual we ate at Theo Randall, and as usual he was present in the dining room talking to guests. Also as usual the food, and service was excellent - I highly recommend this restaurant. I would also recommend walking 10 minutes or so from the hotel to Shepherd Market and eating in Sofra for excellent vegetarian Turkish meze platters.  As many before have noted, the hotel is ideally located and is within walking distance of most London tourist attractions. Yes Wifi is charged for, but from July IHG are providing this free across the world to Priority Club members - so sign up.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and as mentioned many times before, as in all Intercontinentals the beds and bedding are super comfortable for a restful nights sleep, Agraria toiletries are provided and many bathrooms have rainforest showers. Unusually for a hotel at this level, a kettle and tea/coffee are provided in room. As an Intercontinental Ambassador water, fruit and shortbread(!!??) are provided.",5,1,100,InterContinental London Park Lane,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195205-Reviews-InterContinental_London_Park_Lane-London_England.html,London,2

Its definitely my favourite place to stay.  Stayed in an Ocean Front Suite which I would definitely recommend or you will be disappointed. The ocean front rooms are almost directly above the water and you can sleep with the windows open listening to the sound of the ocean, no cars, jut the ocean. In the morning you can see all that nature has to offer: Sea Otters, Pelicans, Seals and if you are lucky maybe a whale with the in-room binoculars.  We enjoyed eating at the Sea Harvest fish market a short walk to Foam Street for good fresh fish at a reasonable price.

Everything went smoothly and we were just as impressed by the hotel, the food, the leisure centre, and the friendly and helpful staff as we were last time. we will definitely be coming again.  I was pleasesd to see that the hotel was quite busy; on the Saturday the very nice, friendly head waiter told us that there were 150 for breakfast - no queuing or waiting for anything though, excellent service with a smile.",5,0,100,"Macdonald Portal Hotel, Golf and Spa",http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499522-d659412-Reviews-Macdonald_Portal_Hotel_Golf_and_Spa-Tarporley_Cheshire_England.html,Tarporley,2
18493,CaffTwo,Hotels,3/18/2014,Second visit - says it all,"Back from our second stay here, having been once before a few years ago. Last time we were in an Executive Double in the more modern extension - this time we went for a Deluxe Double and were at the front of the main house with views over the courtyard/moat/extension to one side and the driveway/carpark to the other. On balance, I&acute;d say the Executive room had a &acute;newer&acute;, more recently refurbished feel, but I liked the character of the Deluxe with the (decorative) fireplace, high ceilings and four poster bed. It also felt bigger and had more natural light due to having more windows (that you can open - no noisy aircon!!), although some of the furniture, whilst attractive and in keeping with the setting, is starting to get a little bit tired and could do with being replaced soon. LOVE how quiet/tranquil the whole place is - hard to believe you&acute;re a few minutes drive from Sutton Coldfield.  There were a couple of minor niggles - one was the lack of plug sockets to charge phones, laptop, iPad and whatnot, although we coped by unplugging the cafetiere and the heater, neither of which we needed - if you travel with a lot of &acute;iGadgets&acute;, it&acute;s cold and you like your coffee, maybe bring an extension cable along? The other was that the wifi was playing up a bit while we were there, but this was down to their service provider having a problem and when we mentioned it at reception they were already aware and in the process of trying to get it sorted - couldn&acute;t really ask for more than that.  Service-wise, like last time, all the staff were friendly and attentive and I couldn&acute;t fault anyone. The food (again, we only sampled breakfast and the lounge menu) was also as good as I remembered, although not cheap, but it *is* a hotel... This time I made use of the spa, set away behind the main house, and I couldn&acute;t fault anything that I experienced - excellent service, modern and what I saw of the pool/hot tub/gym etc. looked first class. Definitely recommend the &acute;lava shells&acute; massage if you like &acute;hot stones&acute; ones - I felt wonderfully relaxed when she&acute;d finished!  Overall, another lovely stay - definitely recommend!",5,1,100,New Hall Hotel & Spa,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190731-d188550-Reviews-New_Hall_Hotel_Spa-Sutton_Coldfield_West_Midlands_England.html,Sutton Coldfield,2

A gorgeous country house hotel in every respect apart from being near the centre of Sutton Coldfield, this place is lovely and made us feel relaxed as soon as we arrived. Our Executive Double room was large and nicely decorated with a massive comfy bed, generous sitting area and a gorgeous view over the courtyard and main house. The breakfast was good with lots of choice and we ate from the bar menu one evening in the hotel lounge which was also very good. We took a couple of strolls in the grounds and surrounding country park during our stay, as well as visiting Drayton Manor Theme Park and the Tamworth Snowdome, both of which are only a 15-20 minute drive from the hotel. If you want to eat out, there are plenty of restaurants within a few minutes drive, including a TGI Fridays, Pizza Express, ASK and several non-chain restaurants.  I shouldn&acute;t really end before mentioning the hotel staff, all of whom were great, but especially Jenny on reception who was brilliant and helped make the holiday for us. We would definitely go back if we ever wanted to stay in that area again - it was just about perfect.",5,1,100,New Hall Hotel & Spa,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190731-d188550-Reviews-New_Hall_Hotel_Spa-Sutton_Coldfield_West_Midlands_England.html,Sutton Coldfield,2

I currently travel between Edinburgh and London on a weekly basis and from the numerous hotels to choose from I always stay here. Location wise it is perfect, away from the hustle and bustle of Central London, but right next door to Gloucester Road tube, so the city is minutes away.  The service received from the hotel is efficient, yet extremely friendly, I am always made to feel welcome as a regular guest, but also see that welcome given to everyone who walks through the door. The check in time at the desk is one of the quickest I have seen in London, if you are like me and just want to get to your room, you will not be disappointed. however if you have questions the staff are extremely knowledgeable and eager to help.  The food is also of an excellent standard, unfortunately the open lasagne is no longer available but the menus in both the restaurant and room service are fantastic and for some dishes pleasingly quirky! (Will let you find out what I mean). Mark in the Bar is always ready to chat, whilst allowing other guests the privacy and silence they want.  Room wise, the rooms are always very clean and the beds extremely comfortable, to the point sometimes you won&acute;t want to get up!

Earls Court was a 10 minute walk away as well so great access to the Exhibition Centre. The hotel itself is beautiful and sitting in the lobby you can day dream back to when this was a row of houses for the rich and gentrified of their day. The service received on both check in and out was of exceptional standards, polite fast and efficient with any delay immediately explained. Room service wa sgreat, can especially recommend the open lasagne with smoked haddock, great value for the price and again the staff were efficient and very friendly. I have a terrible habit when staying in hotels of leaving the do not disturb sign on so was not surprised to find that when returning to my room one evening it had not been serviced. I called maid service, (this was about 7pm), and explained my error and rather than accept their offer of having my room cleaned requested clean towels, these were delivered within 5 minutes and a follow up call was received 5 minutes after that.

Overall a good choice, all staff members are very polite and helpful and genuinely interested in their guests.  The breakfast choice is excellent for one included in the rate.  Yes, the d?©cor is somewhat outdated (or are we all just expecting trendy hotels with wow features now?) However, this year and last, the rooms were very clean and the beds very comfortable - 2 of the most important things as far as I am concerned.  Well located for Crocker Park shopping and restaurants - just across the freeway.  The only negative is the wireless internet, there is no high speed option here for Marriott Elites. The internet mostly worked but sometimes kept dropping, as if too many were connected, this became somewhat irritating and is surprising at a property aimed at business travellers.

The location is very convenient for downtown Cleveland, Rock Hall of Fame etc, Crocker Park shopping, grocery stores and restaurants are just over the freeway and Cedar Point is a 30-40 minute drive away. Westlake is a very nice neighbourhood and is a short drive from the shores of Lake Eerie where there is a very nice beach.  This Residence Inn was clean and well maintained, yes the d?©cor and furniture is now a bit dated and could do with a makeover, but it is in the corporate style of every other Residence Inn. The beds as with all Marriott locations are super comfortable. The pool and pool area were immaculate and the water was kept very clean. The only thing I would comment on (as has someone else) is that other Residence Inns have gas barbeques, and although they do sell coals in reception, on holiday we all have better things to do than mess around with charcoal.  Breakfast had a very good choice of cooked and cold, fruit, cereals etc, far better than most other chains free breakfasts, something for everyone I would say.

The weather was not so good on this visit but even so Jersey has plenty to offer everyone - We visited the zoo and a castle in Gorey (sorry I have forgotten the name) and these are not to be missed - If you hire a car it is great fun to simply drive around the coastline and stop where you fancy...There is a lot to see and enjoy.  The hotel as ever was fantastic with fantastic food and service. If you have not been to Jersey before by plane you need to secure a window seat for the journey as the plane never gets too high on the quick trip and the views on a clear day are unbelievable.

He has had the good fortune of staying in many fine hotels during his short life and his opinion is to be taken seriously!  The stalff are all extremely helpful and the food is fantastic - There is a wonderful Michelin Star restaurant for fine dining or there is a New York style brasserie that is probably more suitable if you have a young family.

8204,Angelschild,Hotels,3/19/2012,Another Brilliant Stay,"We stayed Saturday night, 17th March, on the Groupon deal, it was fantastic. It was our second time, the first being our amazing wedding here last August.  I&acute;m surprised that the reviewer below had issues booking on a Saturday, maybe they left it too late to book on a Saturday night. Half the guests there on Saturday were Grouponers&acute;, when we booked we had a choice of dates, many Saturdays included.  We arrived, check in was efficient, David was very friendly throughout the day/afternoon/evening and at breakfast the next morning. We were in the Iris suite, a Junior suite, was expecting one of the standard doubles for the Groupon deal, so were pleasantly surprised. Enormous bed, almost needed a step ladder to get in, it was comfy too! The bathroom was fine, the shower was almost a little too hot, which is better than it being too cold. There were a couple of things that could do with a bit of attention. The grout could do with whitening, the bathroom would benefit from a lick of paint and a tidy up and the sink had a large crack in it. Also the lighting in the main area of the bedroom was not very good for &acute;getting ready&acute;, make up, deciding on clothes etc.  After popping out to the cinema in the afternoon (a rare child free treat!) we returned to our room to get ready for our dinner. We were asked when checking in what time we would like. We sat in the bar with drinks, bought over by the staff! and given the menu to choose from. It was the same menu as other non grouponers and was very good, lots of choice, in fact it was hard to decide! After a short while we were shown through to the restaurant. The waiting staff were prompt and friendly, bringing up the wine menu and then wine very quickly. The food was amazing, we weren&acute;t disappointed, the Salmon fishcake was fantastic and the steak was cooked to perfection. We were pretty much finished off by desert!  A drink in the bar after the meal was swiftly followed by collapsing into the enormous bed!  Check out was swift and friendly as ever. The staff are a credit to this place, they work day and night with smiles and excellent service. The food is also faultless.  We will definitely return again for food and accommodation!",5,4,104,The Country Cottage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1463401-d270051-Reviews-The_Country_Cottage_Hotel-Ruddington_Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html,Ruddington,2

Our wedding day itself was managed to perfection, any nerves I did have were firmly banished on arrival at the venue, Holly was very attentive and made me feel sure the day would run to plan, which it did, and as a control freak it was hard for me to accept someone else would be finalising all the details, but I couldn&acute;t of been more impressed. The food was fantastic, everyone commented on the standard of the food, it was hot ans served very quickly to all guests and tables. The staff were very efficient, clearing the tables quickly, responding to queries with smiles! The service at the bar was brilliant, it was quick all night, one girl, sorry I didn&acute;t get her name even went to the local shops to buy some crisps for my son who was hungry as they didn&acute;t have any begind the bar, talk about service!! The DJ, the Country Cottage&acute;s resident DJ was brilliant, he took into account our special requests and taste and played fab tunes all night, the dance floor was never empty! Our Honeymoon suite, the Court Yard suite was pleasant, I agree with previous posters that in some rooms the decor is a bit tired, but it was clean, well appointed with toiletries and the bed was comfy! My son shared one of the family rooms with my parents on the night, this suited him perfectly as it was a bunk bed off from their main room, good accomodation for families. Breakfast the next morning was delicious, prepared by the staff who were still clearing the party room at gone 12am the night before!! Overall I was thoroughly impressed with all aspects of the Country Cottage and the service they provided, my wedding day was the most special ever and a huge reason for this was the staff at the Country Cottage, Thanks!",5,1,101,The Country Cottage Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1463401-d270051-Reviews-The_Country_Cottage_Hotel-Ruddington_Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html,Ruddington,2

4567,AV_Surrey,Hotels,7/13/2012,Fabulous Stay,"Fabulous is too small a word to describe the wonderful hotel experience I had at Taj. Right from check in to check out, the time spent at the hotel was simply amazing.. The staff were courteous, smiling, always proactive to serve and above all had fantastic memory, the waiters would remember my preference on breakfast, remembered my name and even tried to save my favourite table on all days..  Not one of the cheapest hotels around yet a stay at the Taj Mahal Palace is surely an experience everyone should try to get, at least once, if not more. The palace wing of the hotel is where one should stay as there are quite a few exclusives for palace guests..  The buffet breakfast had very good spread with multiple choices available, we were also treated to the complimentary evening cocktails and the high tea at Palace Lounge. All of that was a great experience in itself.  I have stayed at the old Raffles Hotel in Singapore which have a same concept as old Raffles and new Raffles but Taj Palace Hotel takes the whole luxury aspect to a new level..  Having stayed at many hotels over the years, I can surely say that the Taj Mahal Palace was the finest I&acute;ve ever stayed in !!",5,5,105,The Taj Mahal Palace,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d302179-Reviews-The_Taj_Mahal_Palace-Mumbai_Bombay_Maharashtra.html,Mumbai (Bombay),2
29165,EEYORETIGGERR,Hotels,12/11/2006,You have to stay here!,"The whole experience of staying at the Taj is incredible, the hotel is part of Mumbia??™s history and you really feel this when your inside the hotel. The service is fantastic, the restaurants very good (although also very expensive!) and the whole atmosphere of the hotel is special. My favourite part of the hotel is pool & fitness area- unusually for a hotel this a straight, large pool (33m I think) so you can actually do some real swimming, it is relatively busy which gives a nice holiday feeling rather than feeling like a cold business hotel. The fitness centre has the latest new equipment with individual TV screens for each machine and again it is actually used by people so there is atmosphere which is nice change for a hotel gym. I can imagine that the Taj is the kind of place people dream at being able to stay in one day and I actually find it offensive (and unbelievable) that anyone could score it a 1 out of 5. Perhaps the bedrooms aren??™t all that special (they are like most standard business rooms) but the whole experience more than makes up for that. My advice to anyone visiting Mumbai is to stay at the hotel and make up their own mind as I think if you go to Mumbai and don??™t stay at the Taj you will definetly regret it.",5,2,102,The Taj Mahal Palace,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d302179-Reviews-The_Taj_Mahal_Palace-Mumbai_Bombay_Maharashtra.html,Mumbai (Bombay),2

The food is simply awesome at this place and we don&acute;t live in Germany, but I make it a point to visit this place every time we are in Country.

They offer excellent wines to pair with the courses and they charge according to how much you drink. As always, I conclude a review with would I go back??? YES...no doubt. Again, this is my favorite place in the world (seriously). The food is too good to avoid and I think the owner will fix the service. I am going to e-mail him about the service we had.  Again, the food here is simply off the charts good and this clearly will be one of the finest places in the world that you will dine. Enjoy this place.

We had stopped by a place near by that was known for it&acute;s crab cakes. The reviews, including Trip Advisor were wonderful for this apparent hole in the wall restaurant. The crab cakes were terrible, but that&acute;s not the point here. We checked into the hotel and were starved. We decided that we needed cheese burgers to satisfy our hunger pangs.  We opted for the hotel and sat in the bar. The waitress took our order and we explained what had happened to us about the previous crab cake place. Pretty soon here comes the Executive Chef of the Marriott with some crab cakes for us to try. He had no idea that I was an Elite member and was just being nice. Chef Ken (as I recall that was his name) was very nice, very cordial and offered his version of crab cakes. These crab cakes were awesome!!! We had our burgers, but also finished off the crab cakes.  The staff at this hotel, especially the kitchen staff under chef Ken and the hotel concierge people up on the concierge floor are simply top notch. This place was booked the last time I had to fly out of BWI and we stayed at the Holiday Inn; big mistake. This hotel should rank as one of the finest in the area, if it&acute;s not already.

The food here was first class. We stayed for 10 nights and were never bored with it. Each night in the main restaurant there is a different theme e.g. Fish, Egyptian, French, European, Thai etc. The restaurant and displays were made up to the theme every night. It was nice to try all the different foods. For the less adventurous there was still plenty of &acute;normal&acute; food on offer. There are 3 Al a Carte restaurants - Fish, Thai and Egyptian. We went to the fish restaurant and were spoilt rotten with the 5 courses and wines on offer. The fish was amazing and the best we&acute;ve ever had. Breakfasts were good. Everything you can think of apart from bacon. Midnight snacks are available from 2330hrs too. During the day the pool bar offers rolls and the Thai restaurant has a fantastic buffet too. There is also Cafe Sissi that serves hot drinks and cake from 4pm til midnight half way up the tower - very nice. The drinks were plentiful and the cocktails were lovely. Never a problem to get served anywhere within a minute or so and all the bar staff were friendly. Bottles of water were readily available and there was no problem at all taking several at a time. There are tip boxes to use at your discretion. It was advised to tip at the end of our stay. The bar and waiting staff never expected a tip and are also not allowed to accept them. The rooms were lovely and big and the bed was massive, much larger than a king size and very comfortable. The air con in the room was very effective too. We never had to reserve sun beds. Always plenty available as well as towels, the pool areas were just the best. No need to take your own towels as you can change the ones supplied as often as you like. The grounds and hotel are spotless. There is an army of workers constantly cleaning and gardening and they are all very friendly. Change your money there. We got 7.9 Egyptian pounds to a pound in the UK, the hotel offered 9.75!! Entertainment was average, we didn&acute;t see much as we were out a lot on the excursions. Overall a fantastic honeymoon.

19800,CarolynLeanne,Attractions,4/13/2012,Truly the happiest place on earth,"This was my 7th trip to Disneyland. Yes, 7th. And the magic is still going strong!  This time my husband and I travelled with our 7 month old son, my two brothers, my parents and my inlaws. One of the great things about Disneyland is that there is something for ALL ages!  The staff are incredible. It was especially evident this time with us having such a young child. The &acute;cast members&acute; as they are called went out of their way to entertain our son while we were in line-ups, to get him to smile for photos and to direct us to the best spots for our stroller for shows, etc.  The characters were incredibly good with our 7 months old. We never felt rushed and a few times we had characters stay longer then they were suppose to just so we could get a quick shot. I think they really understand how special those moments are to us parents.  The shows are spectacular. Everything from Fantasmic, to the evening Fireworks to Billy Hill & the Hillbillies. Even the street entertainers are great. The current parade, Mickeys Soundsational Parade is alot of fun. Great soundtrack and one of the best parades I have seen in my many years as a visitor.  The food varies based on your price range and what your are interested in. We enjoyed eating at The Hungry Bear several times because the food was good and the prices were reasonable. We also love the chicken in the Golden Horseshoe. Another great food stop is a place in Adventureland right across from the Jungle Cruise were you can get yummy meat skewers and warm pretzels.  We were there during Canadian spring break and I was impressed at how short some of the lines were. They really seemed to be trying to operate as many carts and vehicles as possible. And when in doubt, we just used the fastpast system (which is a ticket you can get to return to the ride at a later time with little to no line up.)  If you are going with young children, do yourself a favor and get a 5 day pass. You really do need that time to enjoy the park to what it deserves.  We are already looking forward to our next visit in 2015 when our son will be 4!

29538,EarnyinLA,Hotels,5/30/2011,Favorite place to stay in Macau,"I stayed here back in November 2010 and decided to stay here again. I saw that the Venetian was a little less but I prefer the modern design rooms at the Hyatt. Plus looking at the pictures of the rooms at the Venetian, it&acute;s almost the same as the one in Las Vegas. Checkin went smoothly and was given a room in the Grand Club Tower. Staff were friendly and even showed me how the room functioned even tough I already knew how things worked in the room. I reserved a King Suite like last time and received a room at the end of the floor which had a great view of the pool and venetian along with the rest of the City of Dreams property. The room layout was different from the past king suite but I liked it. The size of the room was large and the bed was very comfortable to sleep in. This version of the king suite has a bigger bath tub and the walkin closet was in the middle of the room. The fitness center at this property is excellent but wish it had a few more machines but it is good enough when on a vacation. The property has a shuttle bus that goes from the City of Dreams property to the MGM hotel in downtown and runs every 20 minutes until 9 PM I believe. There are several restaurants on the property to choose from but room service is pretty good and not too expensive compared to western hotels. I will probably stay here every time I go to Macau.",5,4,104,Grand Hyatt Macau,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g664891-d1605074-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Macau-Macau.html,Macau,3

Checkin was quick and the person who checked me in walked me to the elevator. First step into the room and I was impressed. The living room area is spacious with a sofa and an area with a table like a dining area. You can entertain a group of people here. Next to the living room area is the bedroom. Again spacious area with the bathroom to the right with a tub in the shower area. There are speakers in the bathroom so you can enjoy soaking in the tub while watching TV. There is a nice coffee machine that I did not get to try out. The room has a great multimedia TV that you can hook up your laptop to or MP3 player to play through the TV. They also have a nice fitness center which is spacious with plenty of cardio equipment and some machines for weights. Right next to the fitness center is the pool. I didn&acute;t try the pool but looked huge.  I was originally planning on going to Korea but I had to change my plans due to the instability in the area and decided to come back to the Grand Hyatt. This time I got a room in the grand club tower at the end of the hallway which has a better view. This time I received a view of the Venetian and the Hard Rock Hotel instead of the airport. This was also a King Suite room but the layout was a little different. There was no dining area but the bathroom was better this time. It is also very quiet as there are not rooms next to yours. There is a table in the living area to fill in for the dining area like in the other room. This room also had a walk in closet. Both rooms had 2 large LCD TV&acute;s.  The only complaint I had at this property was that the Hyatt checkin area for Platinum and higher members was not staffed or the person there was not on duty. The second time I arrived there must have been a lot of people checking in at the time as all the staff were helping guests check in. The staff at this hotel are friendly and helpful. Also this area is about 10 minutes from downtown and there is a shuttle that runs between the City of Dreams and MGM every 20 minutes until 9:45 PM. The Hyatt, Crown, and Hard Rock hotels are all in the City of Dreams property.

17546,CAR50,Hotels,2/21/2011,Another Great Stay at the Majestic Theater,"This was our second stay at the hotel. It was as high of quality as our last stay. We arrived at 9 a.m. to check in. I figured that our room would not be ready, but it was, so was able to get checked in and have the valet bring our luggage to the room. The room was quite spacious with a refrigerator, microwave and sofa. The view looking out the window is not much unless you like looking at an office building. However, the quietness and quality of the room made up for that. The bathroom was clean, the showers very nice with the water draining away properly. (I don&acute;t like standing in water that is pooling as I shower.)  What we really like about this hotel is it&acute;s location. It is 3 blocks from the Chicago Art Institute, 4 blocks from the start of the Chicago Architecture Foundation tours (which we would highly recommend to anyone. They have walking tours, bus tours and in the summer boat tours of various parts of Chicago). Also, was about 5 blocks from the Millennium Park parking garage where we were able to take a free shuttle to the Chicago Auto Show. There is some shopping along State Street which is 1/2 block from the hotel. We have not used it yet, but the subway and buses stop within 1 block of the hotel, so can easily get to the Magnificent Mile or the Museum Campus.  The parking fee is a little high at $42 per night. We were able to get that reduced a little with their park and save rate. When we received our bill, we had a charge for parking for the 2nd night we stayed. The desk clerk took care of that with no questions. The valets were very accommodating, even loading our luggage in the car in a pouring rain storm.

The Art Institute was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The Chicago Auto Show was also going on while we were there, so we caught a free shuttle to the auto show from one of the downtown parking garages which was about 10 minutes from the hotel. The location was perfect for what we wanted to do.  The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The valet staff would open the door for you and help you with your bags onto the elevator. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were quiet and beds were soft. There are only 9 rooms per floor, so it was almost like having a whole floor to yourself. The breakfast was good, with scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, waffles and assorted cereals, fruit and muffins.

Lobby was great and there was a &acute;convenience store&acute; in the lobby where you could get food/snacks and travel goods. Plenty of elevators available so getting to the rooms was quick.  Room size was not huge, but plenty big enough. Rooms very well furnished, an iMac in every room. Good bed, chair desk etc... The bathroom was good, with a nice selection of amenities and good shower pressure.  I ate one night in the hotel and the selection of food was good, the quality was excellent, though the service could have been quicker, the staff did apologise profusely. If you stay here then there are loads of places to eat nearby, if you are lucky enough to visit in summer, the river is only 30 seconds away and is lined with bars and restaurants.  My only gripe about the hotel is the parking, or lack of it. You have to park in the Brindleyplace multi storey parking structure, which is ??12 a night. There is not even valet parking.  The attention to detail was great. My hilton hhonnors myWay benefit in HGI is breakfast, but as I didn&acute;t take the breakfast, they automatically credited me 750 bonus points.

8667,AnotherNIteOnTheRoad,Hotels,7/9/2014,A very nice stay,"It??™s a good thing I don??™t take my GPS instructions too seriously, because it took me to an empty field where the Holiday Inn Birmingham-Hoover was supposed to be. Fortunately, I looked around and spotted the hotel entrance.  My check-in at the hotel was efficient enough, the desk clerk was polite but not really friendly. I was not welcomed or recognized as a Platinum member but that??™s okay. I know sometimes desk clerks can get overwhelmed.  I was however, upgraded to a lovely spacious suite. It was a true suite (a separate bedroom with a door that closed) and was very quiet. The temperature for each room was separately controlled. There is a mini-fridge and microwave at the bar area, but it didn??™t have a sink so I think it was more of a staging area for microwaveable food. The TV had a good selection of channels and the internet was sufficiently fast.  The bed was amazingly comfortable, but the pillows which were labeled firm and soft, were all the same. I would have really enjoyed a soft pillow and I know my neck would have appreciated it. Had I stayed more than one night I would have requested a softer pillow and I??™m sure they would have gladly accommodated my request ??“ they seem like a hotel that understands customer service.  The bathroom was huge, and had two sinks with the traditional Bath & Body amenities (coconut lime verbena. I think this fragrance has run its course. Isn??™t it time for a change IHG?) It was interesting to see a full set of amenities for both sinks, a nice touch for a family staying in the suite. Water pressure in the shower was great and bathroom lighting was excellent. Everything in the room was very clean and fresh. Kudos to the housekeeping staff.  This hotel is near a shopping mall and lots of restaurants, but none within walking distance so after a long day I decided not to go out for dinner and just ordered a snack at the bar. The food was okay but nothing special. It seemed like the kind of appetizers purchased at a wholesale club. It was prepared just fine though, so I had no complaints. There were some very interesting characters at the bar who definitely spiced up an otherwise drab evening. (A side note here: I had seen on the website something about a manager??™s reception each evening, but heard or saw nothing about it while I was having dinner at the bar. When I checked out the next morning I asked and found out later that there was complimentary wine and beer. It wasn??™t mentioned when I checked in so I didn??™t know to ask the bartender.)  Overall, I give this property a two-thumbs up. It was a good stay and I will absolutely consider it on my next business trip.

Unlike the Four Seasons, Beverly Wilshire, etc., this is a hotel that hosts very large conferences. Despite this, we have never received less than stellar service, from parking staff on arrival, to front desk and housekeeping. The location in Century City, means that one can walk to all of the office buildings, and is just around the corner from a large very high end shopping mall, that includes both a large selection of restaurants (fast food to very high end) and movie theaters. The location is about half way between Beverly Hills proper and Westwood Village. If the Beverly Hills, Rodeo Dr. shopping scene is your thing, you&acute;ll probably be happier staying in Beverly Hills proper. For those in town for business in Century City, or visiting family on the west side of Los Angeles, this is a perfect location. For those without, or don&acute;t want to rent a car, buses run along Santa Monica Blvd. (2 block walk from the hotel) West to Santa Monica (city) and he beaches and restaurants, and east through Beverly Hills and the Center of West Hollywood. Lastly, About hotel parking. Yes it is expensive, BUT no more and somewhat less than other high end Los Angeles hotels. In fact, the cost of hotel parking is half the cost of San Francisco hotel parking. I do believe that the hotel does offer &acute;room/parking packages&acute; that will make parking a bit cheaper.",5,1,101,Hyatt Regency Century Plaza,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32655-d76442-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Century_Plaza-Los_Angeles_California.html,Los Angeles,3

Century City is located between Westwood Village and Beverly Hills proper.  GREAT DECISION.  Hyatt took over the old Century Plaza some years ago, and turned an old worn hotel into a gem. Having stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Houston several years ago, I have a comparison and it is all positive.  The staff are well trained and very pleasant, making every attempt to make your stay memorable, from those who take your car on arrival, housekeeping, concierge, wait staff, etc.  If you are a gold passport member you will be fortunate to deal with Colleen McCaskey. She is a treasure. We booked last minute during an annual Southern Calif. Dance competition (almost 4,000 dance students from various nearby schools (I believe almost 600 rooms were booked by competitors and their mothers). Colleen found us a good room and looked after every need we might have. - NOTE she is off Sundays and Mondays).  There is a great pool and health club. There are several restaurants as well as places to drink, both indoors and out at the hotel.  My only beef with the hotel is the Starbucks in the lobby which opens early, but also closes by mid afternoon. Please Hyatt, extend the Starbucks hours till at least 7PM.  If you are a shopper, the mall is just steps down the street and around the corner.

We weren&acute;t quite sure what to expect so when we walked in the front door we wondered if the last four years had been kind to La Casa del Garbo...well it has! The rooms were spotless as were the bathrooms. Honestly, it was a bit hard to believe that everything was in perfect condition. Clean walls, no scuffs and the place looked like it did four years ago. Once again we were not disappointed and there is no doubt that the next time we come back to Florence there will be only one place we will stay...La Casa del Garbo!  BTW...we have recommended this place to four other couples and they all loved it.

The location could not be better!  We stayed in the Elenora suite which had a great view of the piazza. The room is just as you see it in the photos. We had a king size bed with plenty of room on each side of the bed. The toom also had a dresser and a small table with two chairs. I felt the room to be quite generous in size given some of the other hotels we had stayed in during our trip to Italy. The room also had two large windows so we always had plenty of light.  Despite facing the piazza and right above a restaurant we never were bothered by any noise. The hotel was, in fact, very quiet...which we really appreciated after Rome.  The reception staff were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet was more than adequate with staff there to make a fresh cup of coffee.  Overall...you can&acute;t go wrong choosing La Casa del Garbo. As with any new trip to an unknown city we read oall the reviews of hotels before we booked, however, there is always that thought in the back of your head that the hotel may not be as described. Not so in this case...a real A+  We will be back!",5,1,101,La Casa del Garbo,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187895-d567763-Reviews-La_Casa_del_Garbo-Florence_Tuscany.html,Florence,3

26396,Deborah0008,Hotels,12/5/2012,Exactly what we needed!!,"It was already our fourth visit to NYC, but the first time we stayed in Brooklyn in the Prospekt Park area. This apartment really felt like home. At arrival we were greeted by the lovely Fraulein. She showed us around, explained some stuff, but she didn&acute;t bother us for the rest of our stay. Fraulein and her husband, who live upstairs, are really great, they even printed some tickets for us.  The apartment is wonderful and we stayed there for almost two weeks very comfortably with three. It has a large living/dining area with a big pullout sofa. The kitchen wasn&acute;t really big, but it contained everything we needed. The owners had even provided some bagels, juice, etc for the first day(s). The bedroom has a queenside bed. The bathroom is rather small (but that wasn&acute;t a problem for us) with a bath (with showercurtain) and toilet. At the back there was also a very lovely garden with garden furnuture (and some nice cats!!). We spend quite some time in the evenings there. The wireless internet was included in the price and worked very well. The only downside I can think about is, there&acute;s isn&acute;t really AC, but there are fans at the ceiling and &acute;blowers&acute; in the windows. It could really get hot in there when temperatures were above 30?°C outside, but you also get used to it really...  Although the apartment is not located in Manhattan, it only takes around 20 minutes to get there by underground (8 minutes walk to Prospekt Park station). The metro runs all night, so no problem getting back there after an evening/night out in Manhattan. The eara didn&acute;t feel really safe at the beginning, but once you get used to it, it wasn&acute;t a problem at all anymore and the apartment itself in located in a calm and quiet street. ;-) There are lots of supermarkets around to do your grocery shopping and also some cheap laundrettes (you will need it for a longer stay as towels and sheets don&acute;t get changed).  I would definitely recommend this apartement if you don&acute;t feel like staying in the noise and buzz from Manhattan.

In the morning we only had to step out of the hotel and into the airport to check in for our flight. The hotel is connected to Trudeau airport by an enclosed bridge, so you do not have to go outside to get to the airport. This also means that you can explore the land side of the airport and eat at the airport restaurants (Tim Hortons, St. Hubert, etc.). We arrived at the airport via the 747 bus and found it easy to follow the signs on the lower level of the airport to the hotel. The reception staff spoke both English and French. We had a suite that had a sitting room, large bathroom, and king size bed. The sitting room and bedroom had a privacy wall but no closing door between the 2 areas. The room also had a refrigerator. The concierge lounge had a great weeknight offering that really was a dinner- glazed pork, salad, vegetables, cheese, desserts, etc. The lounge also had a substantial breakfast offering- with pancakes, sausage, etc. The best part of the stay was that our room faced the terminal and runways.

Any apartment in a room above the 25th floor would give you an awesome view of the Gold Coast, the city as well as the sea. My wow moment at this resort was when I went to bed and as I lay on the bed which was close to the open windows, I could see the whole city of Gold Coast below me and planes landing and taking off from the airport in the distance. I could see the sea as well (though it was not very visible at night). Due to this reason and the beautiful views from the resort alone, I would recommend this propery to anyone and everyone.

This is one of the top 2 places in Honolulu to dine. This away from Waikiki and closer to the central business district. The food at this place is simply awesome. I really enjoy he ahi tuna dishes, altough I know this is a steak house. This place has EXCELLENT wines by the glass, clearly the best in Honolulu.  If you would like a nice single glass of wine with dinner, this is your place. The bar tender will pour you anything you like at a reasonable price and to have a nice wine, without buying a whole bottle is so nice. I am in Honolulu every month and I will eat at THIS Ruth&acute;s at least twice.  They just changed chef&acute;s and the new chef is actually better than the former. This place will not disappoint anyone for food, wine or salad. When you go, you have to try the Cesear Salad. A must. If you want, go ahead and have some extra dressing on the side. Yummy.  Speaking of yummy, the coffee at this location is top notch. The general manager had roasted his own version of a coffee that is nothing short of wonderful.

We stayed here one night, made the reservation by phone from the taxi cab immediately after Lufthansa stranded us and another 600 of our closest friends for one night (3 flights to Frankfurt canceled at the same time) at the Florence Airport. The hotel is small, intimate and lovely. I think that it must be nearly new but it has a character and charm that makes it feel opulent and approachable. Our room was on two levels separated by 6 or 7 stairs. We had two bathrooms and a magnificent sitting / living room with huge windows looking out on the river. They brought us two glasses of Prosecco immediately after checking in ( we had a butler!). We drank them slowly on our little veranda while looking at the Ponte Vecchio while savouring the scene that we would have never experienced if not for Lufthansa&acute;s poor customer service. This may be the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at and it was by accident. Everyone was nice to us at this hotel, some even referred to me by name, really a nice touch. If you are going to be in Florence try this hotel.

The hotel seemed extra busy compared to our previous visit which goes to show that many are likely returning. We had an Executive club room with a 180 window view covering the full towers and some. The room was perfect for our stay and had all the amenities required. Taxis where continuous at the hotel so thankfully never had to wait around and staff always attentive to you and wanting to help.

9917,Aussie067,Hotels,6/6/2009,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Food - Beware the $15 resort fee!!","I stayed at the Trump Hotel & Tower in Las Vegas for 4 nights from the 23rd thru 27th May on the final leg of an around the world holiday. (This included the busy Memorial Day Weekend)  After reading earlier reviews I contemplated changing Hotels but, all things considered, was glad I decided not to. From my perspective the Hotel is definitely 5 Star in terms of comfort & every one of the staff I encountered was extremely friendly and helpful. (Ryan in the bar is awesome and the food is great - try the gumbo on the Tapas menu!!!)  The only complaint I had was the $15 per night resort fee. Thanks to Trip Advisor I was aware I might be &acute;hit up&acute; for this and when asked to accept the $15 per night fee at check-in said I would not be using the resort. I was told it was mandatory but, after pointing out that it didn&acute;t appear on any of the booking paperwork, it was reluctantly waived as a ??˜goodwill gesture??™. (I was firmly advised I would need to pay it next time)  Once back in Australia I did a &acute;dummy&acute; booking on the Trump website and at no time does this $15 fee show up. At best I think this is misleading and can only assume that the reason for this & some of the other mixed reviews is due to Management cost cutting and / or trying to improve the ROI per guest in a tough economic environment. (NB: I would have been happy to pay the $15 per night if I was told about it when booking)  During my stay I asked many other guests if they were aware of this fee and the only one who was had stayed at the Hotel previously.............all were upset about it. I would seriously suggest that Management consider making this charge clear at the time of booking, otherwise they are simply beginning every guest&acute;s stay on a negative note in what is otherwise a great Hotel.  NB: The train didn??™t bother me at all (South Strip View on the 51st Floor) and getting to and from the Strip is easy either along the road or through Nordstrom and the Mall.  Would definitely stay again......But bring your paperwork!!!",5,2,102,Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d1022061-Reviews-Trump_International_Hotel_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,Las Vegas,3
24421,DCBob,Hotels,7/5/2009,Enjoyed my stay at this beautiful luxury timeshare property,"The location of this property is in the heart of midtown Manhattan and it&acute;s on the same block as Carnegie Hall. You couldn&acute;t find a more convenient location to both Central Park and the Theater District.  I checked in the morning of Friday, July 3, which was opening day. The check-in experience was very quick with so many staff members working that day. The staff were all friendly and tried their best to accommodate any reasonable request. I requested and received a Studio Plus room on a high floor (the 20th - the top floor is the 26th). The elevator was fairly quick up to the 20th floor. Key card access is set up in each of the two elevators but is not working yet.  When I opened the door, I smelled the odor of new leather from the stuffed chair in the corner. The next thing you notice is the handsome blonde all-wood floor and an awesome all Italian marble shower stall with a glass wall letting in lots of light from the floor-to-ceiling windows it faces. You can also slide an opaque door to cover the glass wall if you want privacy, but you might prefer not to do that to get the most natural light!  The boutique toiletries are from Archive and include Green Tea & Willow soap and shampoo, Rosehips & Lavender body lotion, and Grapefruit and Neroli shower gel.  There is a 37-inch LG high-def flat screen TV and a Yamaha surround sound projector plus a separate Pioneer DVD player. Full 800+ channel digital cable TV is provided through the Time Warner Cable system. The array of available channels is nearly unlimited. The only downside is mastering the use of three separate remote control devices. There is also free high-speed internet in the room using wired Ethernet access. Wi-fi access should also be available soon.  The bed is comfortable albeit a bit firm for my personal taste. There are three designer lamps in the room, a 2-cup coffee maker, a mini-bar, and a separate refrigerator that you can fill with your own items.   You will find a beautiful Owners Lounge on the second floor across from the fitness center. I won&acute;t comment on the fitness center because I did not use it. The lounge features ample seating both inside and on an adjacent outside terrace. There is no kitchen, so all food is catered by the nearby Redeye Grill.  Continental breakfast is served from 6:30 AM - 10:00 AM seven days a week. They have fresh fruit, Greek-style strained yogurt with fruit or honey, bagels, croissants, pastries, cereal, cookies, cheese and crackers, bread, orange and grapefruit juice in addition to milk and various bottled water, juices, and drinks, coffee and tea, etc.  Evening cocktail hour runs from 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM seven days a week. In addition to soft drinks, red and white wine, canned and bottled beers, and spirits, there are the usual cheeses and fresh fruit plus several hot tapas served from Redeye Grill, including Kobe beef pigs in a blanket, shrimp dumplings, mini quiches, meatballs in marinara sauce, and spring rolls. The food is delicious and a several cuts above the Hilton Club New York, probably because of the caterer used. The spirits are all top shelf (for example, Ketel One vodka and Tanqueray gin).  I truly have enjoyed my experience here and highly recommend it to others.",5,5,105,West 57th Street by Hilton Club,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1308397-Reviews-West_57th_Street_by_Hilton_Club-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,3

In Waikiki for $ 10, you can get a great, (not good, but simply great lunch). I order the lunch special periodically, but my favorite is the clam chowder soup, Manhattan style. My business partners always go for the lunch special, but for me some fresh oysters and a bowl of that Manhattan clam chowder is where it&acute;s at.  I had lunch there this visit, didn&acute;t have a chance to get there for dinner, but I am coming back in a couple of weeks and we will have dinner there. Great restaurant and great consistency.

I found the service, food and atmosphere to simply wonderful. Give this a try as I really doubt that you will be disappointed. In the past, I have enjoyed the Happy Hour there, however, the lunch is excellent. One of my senior managers likes the Mahi Mahi sandwich. I didn&acute;t try the sandwich, but it looked wonderful and he raved about the sandwich.  My favorite is the Manhattan Clam Chowder. I have to say, it&acute;s the best Manhattan Clam Chowder that I have eaten. I only had the clam chowder 2 days in a row for lunch. Give this Manhattan Clam Chowder a try. My favorite.

We had two bookings, one night using Priority Club points in a std room and two nights paying in King Studio Jnr Suite. The hotel upgraded us to a suite for the first night also which was very nice of them.  Over the 4 days we found all the staff on the front desk to be very nice, and very helpful.  The room itself was large, and the bed was super comfortable. The room was also spotless (very clean). The internet and any pay movies in our room were also free to watch anytime, this was handy as one of the days it rained most the day.  The club lounge was good, a limited selection of canap?©s but we made good use of the complimentary beer and spirits each night. We also used it through the day for soft drinks and water etc.  We had breakfast downstairs each day and the selection of hot and cold food was great.  The nearest train station is Temple which was about 10 minutes walk, we are a young couple so didn&acute;t mind the walk. The train station across the road from the hotel is closed, but will be a good spot when it re-opens.  We paid an extra 25GBP to checkout at 5PM instead, which was handy to have an extra shower and freshen up before our long flight back home.

I decided to book this hotel for a 7- nights stay during August since previous tripadvisors??™ reviews where promising. So, I booked it directly form the Hotel??™s website because the prices were the best possible. Things were wonderful from the beginning! We arrived at the hotel and the reception staff was very keen to help us. During our guest registration, a member of staff offered us an ice tea. Then, we were asked if we wanted to be upgraded to Master Suite with an interior swimming pool (check my photos) as we had booked a Dome Suite with an external Jacuzzi at the balcony! We were driven to our suite by a golf cart which we could call any time for our transfer needs within the hotel area as it is build amphitheatrically on a hill. The manager of the reception accompanied us to our suite to check our satisfaction. The suite was amazing! It was very big, spacious, luxurious and well equipped. The design had a fantastic modern Mediterranean - Arabic design touch (check my photos). A basket of fruits and a bottle of Greek wine were offered to us as a welcome gift. The interior swimming pool was quite small but it was an exquisite idea for someone who wants to have a romantic swim. Hotel breakfast was fabulous as the selection and quality of the buffet was first class! I have stayed in many hotels but this is the only one that had freshly squeezed orange juice and a chef was cooking your omelet after selecting the ingredients. We had the opportunity to taste some cretan breakfast since a selection of local pies (cheese and honey) were there. The service again was magnificent. The waitress that served our coffee (cappuccino and filter coffee) the first day was remembering our coffee selection ever after. Most of our time we stayed at the hotel??™s private beach where we relaxed under the shade of olive trees drinking cocktails (8 euros each). The water was crystal clear and the view of Spinalonga Island was unbelievable! We visited The Island (novel form Victoria Hislop) from Plaka (2 km away from the hotel) where boats depart every 30 minutes. The restaurants were very good and we had the chance to taste and enjoy all of them. But the hidden diamond of this hotel is Topos restaurant. I was amazed from the combination of flavors when we tasted the Degustation menu (5 plate menu accompanied with 5 different glasses of wine). I was not expecting to be so excited since I did not knew that the chef was awarded with a Michelin Star! The service once more was unique and we had the feel of VIP. During the evenings, we had the chance to have a drink at the hotels bar where friendly Gianis/John (the barman) was preparing fantastic Mojitos, Caipirinia, Daiquiris and Cosmo! We also had the chance to walk around Agios Nicolaos which is a very nice during the early evenings (check photos).

The butlers were great and the chef once again cooked up a storm for us. We also tried both restaurants, and the food was excellent.  Qunci certainly gives a 5 star service for a 4 star price, and to the credit of the staff and to the owner Scott, who goes above and beyond.

What a way to get away from the busy city hustle bustle Singapore. We were immediately transported into a quiet serene environment with lots of greenery and dim mood lighting. Chill.... Ok so here&acute;s the report:  Checkin: They knew you were coming. I was greeted by my name when i drove in. Complimentary entry into Sentosa and carparking. Bell boy picked up luggage and sent it to room very quickly. Checkin was fast and followed up with a navigation tour around the property by the guest relation / personal assistant.  Property: Nice setup with lots of greenery. Free roaming peacocks and bird species. I could see a party of free ranging wild parrots in the few big trees from my floor to ceiling window. Hearing them calling out freely and playing among the trees were also a delight. The only thing I would say is this property is better suited for couples. Kids would spoil the atmosphere and the elderly and less mobile folks may find it a chore or with much difficulty to walk around the grounds as there are many steps and not as wheelchair friendly. Also signages were abit confusing as on one end lifts take you to the 3rd floor and on the other all the way to the 5th. This is partly due to the propery being sited on a hill.  Staff: Wonderful eager to please staff who tries to make your day. Also, i notice staff are empowered to an extent, so that&acute;s a good thing as nice surprises come your way.... However, staff do not wear name tags which i find it difficult to thank them by name without asking. I probably guess they want to do away with the traditional name badges style. Oh, the night in-room dining captain Ned was a bouncing bunny eager to engage and please his guests. Ask for his mango lassi which he created and is so passionately proud of. I do know he has others up his sleeve too :-)  Spa: Again, some good pampering and with good facilities. I couldn&acute;t get enough of their Experience Shower concept and especially with the Tropical Shower. Worth trying some of the signature treatments.  Breakfast and dining: I only tried breakfast and not the others. In my opinion, breakfast choices while varied, are still pretty limited. Could do with more choices. As i know, they are improving on this which i know they will. Otherwise, its filling on the tummy and wait staff are extremely attentive. Do include some ala carte choices as its part of the breakfast deal as well. We weren&acute;t clearly informed of this on our first breakfast.  Room: The most important of any staycation. Nice comfy bed with fully automated air-conditioning, curtain and blinds, and lighting. Also, an in-room Bose system and speakers with ipod docking adds to the overall touch. My only complaint is that at 0430hrs, the blind started rolling down themselves. Not sure if its a set function feature. Maybe someone can explain that to me here as i did not get to ask at check-out.  Overall, its a truly relaxing great staycation which although pricey, the bliss we got was priceless.",5,2,102,Capella Singapore,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294264-d1307604-Reviews-Capella_Singapore-Sentosa_Island.html,Sentosa Island,6

935,2011ChgoWanderer,Hotels,6/16/2011,Like Staying with an Old Friend,"I had high hopes for the Chancellor Hotel long before staying there based on the great customer service I received during the reservations process. and I was not disappointed when it came time for my stay. From the beginning to end, everyone I talked to was always patient and helpful with my many questions, in particular kudos to Kevin who went above and beyond to take care of my last minute changes and reservation worries.  Yes, the Chancellor is an older hotel. Yes, the rooms are small. No, it may not have all the fancy bells and whistles that other nearby hotels do. But what it does give you is a homey, cozy, comfortable place to call home during your stay that will be the perfect end to a long day of running around. And their attention to detail in many ways will leave you feeling like you truly matter to them as a customer...after my second night, housekeeping realized I was always pulling the comforter down to the end of the bed and made my bed that way every day after that .  Try Luques at least once for a great omelette and stop by the Tour desk for maps. On my first day they gave me the perfect map to help me find my way around town and thanks to them, I didn&acute;t get lost once which is amazing for someone as directionally challenged as myself!",5,0,100,Chancellor Hotel on Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d115644-Reviews-Chancellor_Hotel_on_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html,San Francisco,6

On a quiet street with easy access out to main street via property&acute;s tuktuk at any time of day. Once out on main street, you have the Nana BTS as well to take you around to most spots in BKK. Also along Sukhumvit, you have access to the nightly market, cafes, shopping mall etc etc, endless!  In my opinion, rates are reasonable but hey what&acute;s the point of getting good rates if property is bad, staff is bad etc etc  Staff are friendly and accommodating, some of the staff remember me from previous stays. Hotel is well equipped with a simple gym,self service laundrette room, bar and a small square dip pool. Three strokes take you end to end of the pool :) Rooms are reasonably sized, expect a smaller room if you take the studio but their 2 bedrooms are pretty spacious. Take note also that some same category rooms have different layouts, so contributing to overall size and space.  My only complain is the poor breakfast variety.

As a daimond member we recevied the full benefits, including the high tea and evening cocktails that are normally for suites  We only took ala carte breakfast in the Ren restuarant and this was consistenly excellent.

24192,Cynicor,Hotels,12/30/2011,Too short to fully enjoy this special hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights in early December in a King Conrad Suite.  Overall the Conrad Suites were amazing and the stay was most excellent. The only complaint would be there was no free jacuzzi access for Conrad Suites guests or a separate jacuzzi/sauna facility for Suites guests. We had just come from the Laguna, and apart from location and cheaper price the free spa/sauna/jacuzzi and plunge pools are the only advantages the Laguna has over the Conrad  Check-in was simple and we were able to get early access to our room, waiting only 20min in the club lounge before it was made ready for us. When we were taken to our room we were happily surprised at how massive it was! There was an open-plan kitchen, dining and lounge room, plus separate bedroom, dressing room and bathroom. The bed was soft and comfortable with cute soft toy monkey and turtle. The bathroom had separate toilet, shower and large bath and dual basins. It is of note that many aspects of the room are individually customisable. There is the ability to choose the specific incense used, the CD in the stereo and the fruits for the salad bowl.  Breakfast was taken at the Ren restaurant below the club lounge, and consists of a continental buffet plus a hot food menu to order from which are cooked and presented speedily. The whole breakfast experience was very pleasant with good quality food.  The grounds are expansive but there is no reason to leave the luxury of the suites, with their own private pool. The pool is ~25m long with daybed bungalows lining both sides. While relaxing by the tranquil pool, complimentary water, cold towels, mosquito repellant and occasionally sorbets are brought out for you to enjoy. It is a truly heavenly oasis. The box with water, cold towels and insect repellant is available at all the pools (not just for suites guests).  High tea is also provided at Ren for the suites guests, with a wide selection of drinks to choose from as well as the sweet and savoury food samples. Immediately following this is 2 hours of cocktails and canapes which are delicious and can serve as a light dinner (especially being so close to afternoon tea).  The resort has only 3 restaurants open for dinner and has a very limited room service selection. As we normally take many of our rooms in the hotel, there did not feel like there were enough dining options, but we understand that most people go to the Bali Collection for dinner. When we did visit the restaurants for dinner, they gave every female a red rose. It was little touches like this that made the hotel special.  Because we were only here for 3 nights, we were not able to take advantage of the wide selection of activities the hotel runs. The weekly timetable was a good way of advertising all the hotel had to offer, such as aquarobics, introductory yoga and some cultural activities.",5,3,103,Conrad Bali,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1465999-d320013-Reviews-Conrad_Bali-Tanjung_Benoa_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html,Tanjung Benoa,6

Check in at the executive club on the 36th floor was an oasis of calm after a long day of travel. A glass of champagne was offered and there&acute;s an excellent selection of hors d&acute;oeuvres. The rooms are modern, spotlessly clean with exceptional bathrooms that are both spacious and exceptionally well appointed. Large soaking tub with rubber ducky, seperate shower with choice of shower heads, regular and rain shower. Marble floor and excellent selection of amenities includng shaving kit and toothbrushes. The staff are incredibly solicitous and accomodating and efficiently booked restaurants for us and providing maps and directions for us to give to the taxi drivers. I also highly recommend the health club, which has a good gym, great swimming pool and exceptional men&acute;s locker room with sauna, steam room and jacuzzis. This was my fifth or sixth visit to the Conrad Tokyo and every stay has been completely satisfactory.

6766,Alycidon,Hotels,6/29/2015,Yet another great stay in this friendly guest house,"This is at least my second review of Craigard House, I first stayed in 2008, and it remains as good as ever. I use it as a base for cycling, particularly to Kinloch Hourn and Arnisdale (the latter with car assistance) but there&acute;s also some great walking and the lovely nearby town of Fort Augustus which has a charm all of its own. The biggest draw for me however, is the warm welcome that always awaits; the house is old but very well decorated and furnished in a manner that is in keeping with that. I heartily recommend Criagard House as a base for a few day&acute;s local touring or as an excellent stopping point to or from the west coast.",5,0,100,Craigard Guest House,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g551968-d583854-Reviews-Craigard_Guest_House-Invergarry_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,Invergarry,6
6784,Alycidon,Hotels,5/23/2008,Friendly guest house in the Scottish highlands,"Craigard House is run by a very friendly and socialable English couple. They&acute;ve only recently taken over and are clearly keen to make all their guests feel very welcome and comfortable. The premises are spotlessly clean; the furniture generally matches the house which is, I guess mid-Victorian. Breakfast was of a good standard and the evening meal, cooked by Andrew, easily bettered the offering of the local hotel bar. I stayed here on my own for a short cycling holiday and within five minutes of arriving felt like I was back at home! Pots of tea were offered every day when I came back from my cycling trips and Andrew and Joy took a genuine interest in what I&acute;d been up to. One or two minor niggles were immediately dealt with politely and I was thanked for pointing them out. Invergarry is half way between Fort Wiliam and Inverness. If you want to go to Scotland and be in a cold, over-crowded holiday town go to Fort William. If you want to see real Scotland and have a warm welcome go to Craigard House. Invergarry is quiet, fairly remote and with few facilities but for some of us that is what we go to Scotland to find. The local cycling is superb as the Great Glen Way is just a mile away, you can access Invereness and Fort William by bike (or foot) without going on the dreadful A82. The road to Kinlochhourn is stunning beyond words but not for the unfit cyclist! At 22 miles each way (and 700 metres of climbing) it&acute;s a bit of a long walk so you might need a car. I used a hire car (Enterprise car hire are good value right now) to get my cycle to places I wanted to explore, this included the road from Glenelg to Corran, fantastic if you like hills, and the gorgeous Glen Strathfarrar near Struy. All dead end roads that are light on traffic as a result.

You can get table reservations and shop without massive queues and crowds. You can over the river to the Tate modern and all that the South Bank and London Bridge areas offer. I was meeting my daughter at London Bridge Station and it was a lovely 20 min walk along the river, even on my own in the early evening. The hotel staff where very friendly . This is often lacking in a large city but they went out of their way to be courteous and friendly. The room was lovely, a good size for London. Massive comfy bed, bathrobes, slippers, tea and coffee and nice toiletries - everything you would expect of a 5*. Food, drink etc where expensive but no more then you would expect in this type of hotel. I was slightly taken back when we rang downstairs to ask if they had any dvd players to borrow as my daughter wanted to show me something she had done at college. Yes madame but there is a charge of ??50!! slightly expensive I think for a 10 min home made show reel. A deposit perhaps, I will just have to wait till Christmas!

We were placed in a large room on the 18th floor, (not the cityview I expected, but an excellent room). I cannot say enough positives about this hotel and its staff check in excellent, room excellent, cleanliness excellent, service excellent, checkout excellent. Breakfast was free so it is hard to complain about, I have noticed the management are upgrading the breakfast, so that too will be excellent. The location is fantastic,(despite what you read on other reviews)the hampton Inn Soho is so cose to all that NY has to offer, two subways within walking distance, fabulous Soho shopping and dining right at your door, the delights of the West Village, Tribeca, downtown, Chelsea, Greenwich Village, all so close. We stayed there at the time the previous reviewer mentioned the problems with getting the rooms, all I can say is that I noticed staff working so hard to provide alterative arrangements for the guests, way into the night which was fantastic to see. This hotel is spotlessly clean, well presented, very safe and very well staffed.

This beachfront hotel, with balconies overlooking the pool, jacuzzi and ocean is no exception. The rooms are fairly standard but the balconies are large and have wonderful views. We booked a standard room and were upgraded to oceanfront (which is not a Hhonors perk at Hampton Inns) so it is nice to be recognized as a repeat customer (we liked our room so much in February we extended our stay by a day).  Service was friendly, breakfast area nice (if the lady with the fat feet who walked around barefoot is reading this - save it for your house please), and it is conveniently located across the street from the Sunset Grill which unfortunately was closed for renovations.

Friendly and helpful staff. Very comfortable rooms with outstanding views - we prefer the airport rather than city view rooms and are transfixed by the picture window. I was suprised that someone had a disappointing room as we have always been more than happy with the facilities. We pay $40 extra and upgrade to an executive room - this gives you a room on the high floor and snacks are served between 6-8 pm in the executive lounge and then a complimentary continental breakfast is served between 5.30 and 10 am. There are cookies and soft drinks available at other times. The &acute;Publik bar&acute; in the lobby serves a varied menu which is of a good standard - however this is quite expensive.

With a huge lobby and reception area I was surprised that there was only one receptionist on duty - although there was a wait she did a wonderful job and was friendly and efficient - we had the sleep in package and she extended the check-out until 4pm which was much appreciated. We had an executive room on the 10th floor overlooking the airport. The room was clean and well maintained with excellent sound-proofing. The executive suite offered drinks, snacks and a very nice breakfast along with public computers, comfortable surroundings and a beautiful view of the city. The walk to terminal E was very easy from the hotel - and certainly not as much trouble as getting taxis etc. The courtesy bus dropped us off at the subway and picked us up when we called - the driver was very nice and helpful.

2160,4959keeton,Hotels,8/9/2012,Best location for theater goers,"This is the second time I&acute;ve stayed at this property. I was impressed the first time because the location is right next to many theaters without being directly in the swarming hoards of tourists in Times Square. 8th avenue abuts the east side of Hells Kitchen, which is a much more interesting area when searching for restaurants and a more genuine New York neighborhood feel.  The staff there is exceptional, and unlike most Hilton Garden Inns, there are bellmen and a concierge, if you need them.  The room itself is an average size - which means large by New York standards. It has all of the Hilton Garden amenities including a small fridge, microwave and that wonderful Hilton Garden adjustable mattress. My room was on an upper floor on the rear side of the building. The only view was of the water towers of the buildings behind but it was quiet. There was complimentary Internet which had decent speed and the flat screen TV actually had some hi-def channels.  There is an attached restaurant (Pigalle) which seemed to be popular with the pre-theater crowd. If your Hilton status or plan includes breakfast, they offer a breakfast buffet, which was pretty good.  If you need/want to be in the Times Square area but (slightly) away from all the tourists, this HGI is definitely worth checking out.",5,0,100,Hilton Garden Inn Times Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d99352-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,6
16562,BrlDsguise,Hotels,6/8/2010,Very nice hotel - would stay again,"I just returned from Hawaii and had 3 and 1 night stays at the Hilton Hawaiian Village bookended around a trip to the big island.  I am a Hilton Honors Gold VIP - booked a Rainbow Tower Oceanfront room for the first three nights and was offered the top (31st floor) floor with a view of Diamond Head when I checked-in online the day before. All HHonors members have a separate check-in line as do Gold/Diamond VIPs so we didn&acute;t have to wait in the long line. I believe if you check-in online you can just bring your confirmation to the room key desk and pick up your key and also skip the line. Beware - the police were taking a report from someone who apparently had luggage stolen so keep your eye on your property at all times (a good idea everywhere but it is easy to see how you could be careless in the hotel lobby).  The room was somewhat dated with a worn carpet that really needed replacing and wallpaper that peeled near the shower but the view of the ocean and Diamond Head made up for it. A little surprising since when I stepped off the elevator the hallways were really nicely done.  The staff is very friendly especially the parking attendants (I splurged the extra $6/night for valet). The grounds are beautiful and the big pool was nice - a little difficult finding lounges in the early afternoon. Good beach - snorkeled right off of it and saw some nice fish. I really liked the fact that it was away from the packed beaches further up in Waikiki where the lounge chairs were in some cases almost on top of each other. Within walking distance of some nice restaurants/bars like Duke&acute;s and Shorebird.  They have a continental breakfast for Gold/Diamond VIPs that consisted of various pound type cakes, fresh fruit, cereal, juices and coffee/tea in a lounge. Shame it closes for the day after breakfast so no snacks or beverages in the afternoon or evening.  Our last night we booked an Ocean View room and was given the top (35th) floor of the Tapa Tower - also online check-in the day before. A much nicer room - larger, newer and well furnished. Similar view as the Rainbow - just part of Diamond Head was obstructed by other buildings.  Overall I would look to stay there again if I went to Oahu and have no trouble recommending it.",5,1,101,Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,Honolulu,6
13355,Bertybign,Hotels,4/28/2013,Great service as usual but 30min weight for an elevator!,"This is our sixth time here and we feel like it is our second home now.  We do not come to visit the studios but they are really close just a short walk down the hill in a very safe area. The gardens are well kept with an attractive array of flowering plants. Nearby down Ventura Av. there is a very wide selection of fine restaurants.  Check in was painless and fast with friendly staff who took the time to escort us to the elevators. The room was spacious and clean with good views across the valley with fast wireless ($8). The bathroom was also of a good size with bath tub and shower above. If you decide to have a bath then you can only fill the tub by standing up to turn the water on which is irritating.  The buffet in the restaurant is OUTSTANDING with a huge selection of sushi, oysters, crabs and almost everything imaginable all for $55 per head. The bar has the best beer in the world ( ) on draft which is an example for the hotel&acute;s attention to detail. Most evenings and lunchtimes there is live entertainment of a high quality (watch out for JC Curtis).  Self parking is easy and immediately below the hotel although very expensive at $24 per day.  This is a great hotel that has a buzz about it that is attractive and relaxing.  The biggest gripe is the non-availability of elevators during check out time. W waited nearly 30 mins for an elevator to reach the 9th floor that had any space for the two of us with luggage. The solution is to take the next elevator going up and to then ride it up and back down. I know that this makes the problem worse for everyone but that&acute;s life!

Elevators are fast and numerous with almost no wait in both directions. Staff are friendly and give the impression that they genuinely want to help whever they can. The room was very quiet, spacious with a well fitted bathroom and the air con worked perfectly. Wireless internet had a good reception in the room but was quite slow all for $8 per day. (Careful, they charge for each device connected!). The outstandng feature of this hotel is the fantastic buffet meals served every breakfast ($20) and Dinner ($44). The quality is excellent and variety outstanding with live music (piano) in the evenings.. The only negative comment concenrs the restuarant waitresses who expect 15-20% tip even though I served myself at the buffet.

We had no problem with the small amount of noise we could hear from the building construction next door, but you do hear it. Housekeeping were exceptional, room was alweays clean and fresh.

23669,Craigy,Hotels,2/3/2008,Fantastic Choice,"Stayed here December - January for 8 nights. After arriving a day late due to airline delays and after commuincating this with a female manager regarding my delay, we arrived to what can only be described as a fantastic customer service experience. The said female manager had upgraded our Hilton net direct booking for a King room, to an amazing executice king on the top floor with a private balcony. The room was huge, comfortable and a killer view of the bay. The balcony was fantastic. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room itself was in immaculate condition. Maid service was also excellent. Executive room facilities were also great. The only things I was a bit disppointed with were, the buffet breakfast we had our first morning in the restaurant, way over priced for what you get, also the cocktail bar, there was a waitress who thought her job was not to serve the customers, but to stand and joke with friends and the bar tender for most of the time we spent there. Having said that these points were minor compared to the experience we had with the lady manager and the room we were given. Also the location is fantastic, you have North Beach (great italian), Chinatown and downtown right on your door step, fishermans wharf and Union Square all so close to walk to.

Breakfast was incredibly busy with only 2 waitresses on - they worked hard though and the buffet was constantly replenished with a good range of fresh food.

Unfortunately breakfast though was very disappointing however - there was only 1 waitress on and it was one thing after another - in the end I was tired of getting up complaining so paid the bill and left. The coffee was cold, the eggs benedict were hard boiled and swimming in a sloppy sauce, potatoes with breakfast were hard, we had to chase up juice, tomato sauce etc. Reading other reviews about the breakfast we may just have had bad luck on the day - there was a large coach party also in the dining room - but really the waitress may have been better off advising us that we would be better off waiting an hour and we would have gone elsewhere.

21627,Chris1978,Hotels,4/27/2015,"3rd time, and still going good",". I&acute;ve reviewed this hotel before, at least once (maybe twice) so rather than repeat my previous ramblings or confirm others, I thought I would add some things which may have improved or worsened over those visits. I would add that we had a fantastic stay and will return again, why? Quite simply the kids are at an age where they don??™t need anymore than this hotel offers, the pool is warm all year around and it ticks boxes for us as well, and if the kids are happy then so are we! The pool is a massive pull for us, perfect for the kids and so warm, so even if it is cloudy the kids are as happy as Larry.  Wifi - we managed to get wifi across the complex this year, not fast but enough to get basic connections and to avoid having to camp out in reception like previously. An improvement from last year  Dinner - personally I think the food has been &acute;dumbed&acute; down since previous visits. Whilst it is still good, there seemed a lot less quality of choice and a lot more basic easy preparation food such as sausages, chips, cheap squid rings etc. Maybe it was because it was school holidays and aimed more towards kids, or simply maybe not. The food is quite bland, no spicey dishes of any note. Hotel should do more themed nights, I know its clich?© but why not do a curry night or oriental night or similar. After 7 nights of mostly the same food a change is good!  Breakfast ??“ the fresh juices/shakes are now a daily occurrence which is good, and the new coffee machines produce a good early morning cuppa. If you are English and like a cup of Tea, bring your own tea bags to breakfast. There seemed lesser quality of selection of cold meats than previously years. To be honest, breakfast became very samey after about 4 or 5 days, and after 8 or 9 nights we found ourselves having less and less. The Scrambled eggs were often too runny, and those toasters??¦..please just bin them they are rubbish!  Bar Prices ??“ these haven??™t changed a great deal, but I can??™t understand how a small bottle of water costs more than a glass of wine! Spain for you Animation ??“ A good friendly bunch who work very hard morning day and night. Not as good as previous teams but nonetheless they try hard. Please don??™t expect good evening entertainment. Other than Elvis and the Beatles it is pretty awful. If you go there expecting nothing you may be pleasantly surprised. But it??™s a family hotel and come 10.30 the bar is almost empty.  Diving ??“ The wife finally got back underwater for a dive, the dive centre were professional and surprisingly the dive site produced a good dive with plenty of fish. HB/FB or AL ??“ Since we have two young kids All Inclusive just doesn??™t make sense for us. We just get a hotel credit card and put everything on that. On 11 nights we only racked up 180E. We did stock the hotel room and fridge up but once the kids disco is done and dinner and then the place cleared out soon after the entertainment is finished there it??™s back to the room with the kids and to finish off the wine you opened earlier! The supermarket next door is so cheap, you can get a quality bottle of wine for ??10E or something else for 1E -either way it works out better for us. When you have two young kids you just don??™t get time to spend money sipping beer or wine in the bar unfortunately, normally chasing them around! Location - This hotel is at the better end of the resort. Just take a walk to Torviscos and you will see why  Food Hall - As another reviewer mentioned, the new continental food hall in the plaza next door is excellent. You just need to find it as it??™s a bit hidden away on the 3rd floor of the plaza.

We went with our 2 yr old, with no expectations other than a holiday in the sun, but came away taken by the place, and have since booked back.  I won&acute;t reel off what everyone else has said, as on the whole TA reviews reflect things well. What I would say is that is a very unpretentious place without being chavvy. Bare in mind we went during the school holidays, there were a lot of children and they were all well &acute;parented&acute; - I&acute;m sure you know what I mean. The complex has a lovely feel about it, best described as relaxed and friendly.  The pool was our biggest selling point, there are not many hotels with heated pools in Tenerife without paying mega bucks, and this pool didn&acute;t disappoint. Even on a cold day the pool was still warm and swimable.  We went AL and made good use of it. I&acute;m still not convinced the value in it, but it does take the hassle out of things. We are going back next year and going HB, only based on the fact we will have a young baby and wont make great use of the drinks, and with there being a cheap supermarket next door we will just use that a fair bit.

It is in a good location-walking distance from the train station and very near a U-Bahn entrance. The walk from the train station went through some dingy areas of the city but the hotel itself is on a pretty street near a park. The reception was warn and the owners and workers showed an exceptionally high level of hospitality throughout my stay. They provided excellent directions and suggestions for things to do. My room was small but spotless. Since the hotel is relatively inexpensive some travelers might want to pay a bit more for the larger rooms. The internet was free and worked well. There was a great breakfast included in the room rate. One service I particularly appreciated was their willingness to let me book a room that I could use early in the morning after paying a few that was around half the room rate.

As before, service was consistently excellent. Very good English spoken by all reception and concierge staff members. Room was very comfortable and impeccably clean. Had dinner twice at Touzan - kaseiki ryori and sushi - and although good quality found it a tad expensive and not the stellar experience of the kaseiki at Shunbou at the Grand Hyatt in Tokyo. Restaurant staff had equally good language skills as their colleagues elsewhere in the hotel. Pastries at the bakery (open till 9:00 pm) very good and much cheaper than the average fare at the hotel. Discovered the bakery by accident as I cannot recall seeing it listed or advertised elsewhere. Decided to have pastries with tea in Italian restaurant and was offered very good tea selection. Found the location to be perfect, with relatively easy walking to the Gion. Next to the Sanjusangen-do temple and close to the Kiyomizu-dera temple which is a good start for temple sightseeing in Kyoto. General manager Ken Yokohama and his staff should be commended for an excellent job. Next trip to Kyoto will undoubtedly take me to the Hyatt Regency again.

Granted I went in both hungry and with low expectations (I find the Aussie themed American restaurant a little cheesy) but I was amazed to have one of the best burgers I??™ve had in a long time (Gourmet or otherwise).  Whether the stars aligned for my meal or not, I cannot say, but Outback earned all five stars that day.",5,1,101,Outback Steakhouse,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34515-d543852-Reviews-Outback_Steakhouse-Orlando_Florida.html,Orlando,6
6620,AlvinTSingapore,Hotels,10/25/2015,Great Staycation for the birthday,"Room rate was very reasonable compared to the others within the vicinity and this was for the Club Floor and its associated privileges.  As a local, car-parking privileges is very important. Parking is at the Marina Square shopping mall via the hotel&acute;s dedicated entrance. FOC parking good for two exits per day during my stay here but I think they aren&acute;t really strict on this.  Dedicated check in via the Club room check in on ground floor, took couple of quick mins no hassle. Room was pretty standard but slightly larger than many hotels. Standard amenities provided and as a Club room, non-alcoholic beverages were free to consume from the mini-bar  Champagne breakfast, high tea and sunset cocktails privilege on the 38th flr Club Lounge. Impressive service, staff and privileges with alcohol during the sunset cocktail hour. Nice cozy lounge to relax to take in the view and chit chat, but unfortunately, the city was clouded with haze from the Indon fires during the stay. Breakfast at The Edge which has a pretty impressive of local and western varieties to taste. Nearby major shopping malls for those who need some retail therapy.  Express check-out provided which again wad a bonus to avoid the queues.

They were in the midst of renovations and went out of their way to give me a room away from the floors where work was being done and give me a newly renovated room. So naturally I remembered this and was happy to book here again. I had a room one floor from the top, again a spectacular view, very comfortably appointed. Bath robes and slippers provided were noted as part of their attention to detail, although we didnt get around to using these.  The close proximity to the MBK centre is so useful. There are also nice little markets just across the road. Taxi drivers all know exactly where this hotel is and the trip to the airport is fairly quick and painless.  I was impressed when the lovely lady at check-in was able to tell me when exactly I&acute;d stayed here before and what my room preferences were. Needless to say, I would not consider another Bangkok hotel other than this one.

This was our first visit since the new manager has taken over and we were very impressed with the changes being made, for example the hotel restaurant was in the process of being refurbished very stylishly. We spent some time chatting with him and were impressed with his vision for the hotel. As ever the staff were extremely friendly, welcoming us like old friends, and catering to our every need. We celebrated our third anniversary whilst there and were thrilled to receive champagne and flowers in our room.  We were particularly interested to be told that around half of the staff at the hotel have been there since it opened 12 years ago. This speaks volumes for the company ethos and the dedication of the staff to make every visitor&acute;s stay an absolute pleasure.  Please see our previous review for this hotel and everything we praised previously is still as impressive as ever!",5,3,103,Porto Santa Maria Hotel (Porto Bay),http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189167-d250768-Reviews-Porto_Santa_Maria_Hotel_Porto_Bay-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,Funchal,6
11066,BMBeer,Hotels,7/12/2011,Outstanding,"Before I start this in-depth review of the Hotel Porto Santa Maria I just want to say we have just returned from our 4th stay at this hotel in the past 3 years and decided its time to review it. It would be possible to just write ??˜Outstanding??™ and leave it at that but the hotel and staff deserve more.  First the location: the hotel is set in lovely surroundings within the Old Town district of Funchal, which is it??™s first positive quality being one of only a couple in this special area and well away from the ??˜hotel zone??™ a few miles away. Facing directly onto the sea at the front, with the back facing the old cobbled streets lined with numerous restaurants and little shops with locals going about there daily work. This really is the perfect location if staying in Funchal. There is no traffic noise in most rooms as unlike some hotels there is no main road running past it. It is only about 10 minutes walk to the main shops and of course lovely flat walk along the seafront.  The Hotel itself is immaculate, with the grounds beautifully maintained and the interior common areas like the bar, foyer, restaurant etc spotless. The rooms are excellent, with a small kitchenette with stove, fridge, sink and all the pots and pans, utensils you need. Rooms are a good size with smart furnishings along with the bathrooms equally smart and clean. Whether you choose a garden view or full sea view, all have lovely balcony with table and chairs.  The food in the hotel is very good. Breakfast is a full buffet with everything you could want, fresh and if you have cooked, hot. We have never had problems getting a table at a variety of times and there are chairs to sit outside if you prefer. Evening buffet is also excellent, themed each night, e.g. Italian, Madeiran etc always with a big selection as well as a??™ la carte. In the summer months they do a weekly BBQ outside which always seems special to us especially if timing it with the Atlantic Festival fireworks that take place each Saturday evening in June at 10:30pm.  The main part of this review though should be dedicated to the people who make this hotel what it is, as said above it is immaculate, in a good position, with lovely rooms and food, but all that would be worth nothing if it wasn??™t for the staff. They are outstanding, always friendly, smiling, very hardworking and extremely helpful. We have never failed to be surprised by how people remember you and welcome you as if you live there! The addition of Lina as customer services manager is a stroke of genius as she works so hard to make sure every guest is having a wonderful time.  We have travelled to various countries and stayed in a variety of hotels but have not yet stayed in one that matches the Porto Santa Maria. There is a level of service that goes above and beyond most establishments. The manager of this hotel Virgilio Silva is obviously doing things exactly right and he should be proud of his and his staff??™s extremely hard work in keeping this hotel exactly as it is.  In short if you want a hotel that is immaculate, quiet, friendly with excellent service in Funchal you need look no further.  Other hotels would do well to look at the Porto Santa Maria and realise it can be done!",5,10,110,Porto Santa Maria Hotel (Porto Bay),http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189167-d250768-Reviews-Porto_Santa_Maria_Hotel_Porto_Bay-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,Funchal,6

Premier Inn Glasgow City Centre South is historically not in the City Centre, but in an area once called the Gorbals, the worst ever slums in Europe, the area has changed beyond all recognition and is constantly improving, and this hotel stands proud with its semi circular facade.  Got a lovely Glasgow welcome from reception, and both of us being part-Glaswegian it was a &acute;Welcome Home&acute;, then everything else within the hotel was at Premier Inn&acute;s best. Room. bedding, facilities, restaurant, and very friendly and happy staff.  You&acute;re nae far from the City, just walk 5 minutes along Ballater Street to Bridge Street Subway Station (Glasgow&acute;s wee underground is called the Glasgow Subway) and one stop to St.Enoch or two stops to Buchanan Street takes you into the heart of the City, 7 stops around its circular route takes you to Partick for the Riverside Museum.

We managed to park on the road outside of the hotel as it was free until about 8am (ish) when we would be gone, thus saving the overnight car parkinf free. Kiosk check was fab and quick - saved the massive queue at the manual checkin desk. Everything you needed was in the room, it was comfy, had extra pillows, nice cup of tea and free wifi for 30mins. Only dissapointment was that we didnt stay longer. We didnt actually encounter any staff as everything was great.

Had dinner at the Alto restaurant. Enjoyed the steak and asked the waiter for a dessert recommendation. He completely delivered! The chocolate brioche bread and butter pudding was absolutely fabulous. Only comment would be that the hotel room guide provided instructions for the unsecured Internet option, rather than the secure option. The service desk immediately gave me the password for the secure site (required to use it to sign into my remote access for work) but I wasn&acute;t sure why they didn&acute;t just include that either in the guide or at sign in, if they want to change the password regularly.

2002,422,Hotels,6/25/2012,Fantastic hotel and staff,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights whilst my husband ran the Marathon and to celebrate our wedding anniversay. Couldnt have picked any better... From checkin to check out everything and everyone was wonderfull. The lady at checkin was very friendly and interested in our journey, we decided to pay the upgrade to club which gave us free breakfast a lovely coffee machine and fantastic views, free movies and no room service charges. Once we were in our room she rang to check if all was to our liking - indeed it was. The room was very modern and spacious, bedding was so comfy along with the bathrobes and slippers. We went out to explore and on our return they had left us a lovely card, chocolates and fruit for our special occasion. Due to the bad weather we did spend a lot of time in the room but the view made up for it. The hotel is so centrally located, every where is easily accessbe by either walking or train. The station is right next door along with plenty of eateries. Vapianno around the corner was our favourite. The Arlanda express station is a 3 min walk - whoever on arrival it took us quite a while to find the hotel as Stockholm is quite a confusing city to begin with. When we lef tit was no problem. Breakfast was superb, huge variety of evrything you could think of or want. One morning we had it delivered to our room for no extra charge. We ate once in the steak house which was excellent and decent value. Stockholm is not a cheap place especially if you want a drink. The hotel did not charge much extra to what we were paying outside.

12328,Basics100,Attractions,8/12/2014,"History, politics and culture at its best","I contacted real English tours through their website and Richard (Liz&acute;s husband) sent me a very friendly and informative email about all the tours that were available to me. He also explained that they were out of season, what with it being winter, but Liz would be more than happy to do a private tour with just me. I booked the historic centre tour and wasn&acute;t disappointed.  Liz is a lovely and friendly lady, who met me in my hotel lobby and took me to the historic centre by bus. She is an absolute fountain of knowledge on history, politics, culture, buildings, artists and current affairs: all things Montevideo and Uruguay! Along the way she pointed out landmarks and buildings and not only explained their relevance verbally, but accompanied these explanations with lots of maps and pictures of buildings dating throughout history, showing their relevance and development, so you could really get a feel for the context.  It was lovely to learn that most museums in Montevideo are free to visit and Liz took me into a lot of them, not only to see what was on display, but also to see the architecture from inside the building. Many of these buildings are restored mansions dating from 1800s to the 1930s when the city was at its most wealthy. Buildings included a fabulous French palace, the old post office, the cathedral and inside the lottery building!  Liz is very clear, informative, friendly and adaptable with what you want from the tour. She also makes other suggestions about where to visit for the remainder of your stay. I believe it was great value for money as I ended up spending 5 hours with Liz, and if you consider the wealth of information you learn about the city and the country, in such a small amount of time, it&acute;s money well spent.

11053,BMBeer,Hotels,10/13/2013,Quiet comfort in a busy city,"We stayed at the Signature at MGM for 4 nights during September. There are 3 towers joined to the MGM Grand hotel via a covered walkway of which some are moving so does not take long to get to the MGM if you want to use there services. Check in was fine and our request of a high floor was met and we were given an upgrade to a balcony room. Upon arriving at our room we found the door lock was broken so could not enter. A security guard called Jason was very friendly and helpful while we waited for an engineer to come and replace the lock. A few days later we received some beers and chocolate covered strawberries with a lovely card appologising for the door issue. This was a nice gesture and much appreciated (thank you Jason!) The room itself was a signature balcony deluxe suite which was very well appointed, large bathroom, big jacuzzi tub, large walk in shower, two sinks and a separate toilet. Bedroom and lounge area had sofa, dining table and chairs, and the kitchen had a coffee/tea maker, fridge with ice box, microwave and plenty of utensils. Due to the lack of nearby dining options for breakfast (although there is a Delights cafe in tower 2) we had breakfast in our room each morning which saved money and was more relaxing. The large sliding patio doors opened onto the balcony which gave a good view, once closed there was no sound so very peaceful and quiet in your room, as was the whole tower. We did not hear noise in the corridors as you would in some other hotels either. However, we did meet another English couple staying in a room opposite ours and overlooking the wet republic pool and when we went on their balcony, the music was extremely loud, even 33 floors up. The Signature is very different to the resort hotels, peaceful and quiet and a tranquil area after you have enjoyed the noise and bustle of Vegas (if you follow our room tip!!) although only about 15 mins from your room to walk to the strip, you can go through the MGM grand or out the main entrance to the towers and turn left onto E Harmon Ave. Having stayed in the Luxor previously, we did miss some of the atmosphere of being in a casino hotel and were disappointed by the fact we were not given any discount vouchers for use in the MGM Grand. However if you want a peaceful escape from the rest of the Strip, this is definitely for you. In short this is a quiet, peaceful place to stay with very clean well appointed suites but only a short walk to all Vegas has to offer. One note is although there is no charge for car parking, it is valet only.",5,1,101,Signature at MGM Grand,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d601419-Reviews-Signature_at_MGM_Grand-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,Las Vegas,6

We had a family and a twin room with cot booked and had asked that they be as close together as possible. When we checked in and got to our rooms we found that the family room was infact 2 seperate rooms with an interconnecting door - this was just fab as we have teenage girls who like their privacy and mirror space. The twin room was next door but on investigation realised that the room next to our interconnecting one was also a twin with another interconnecting door. I quickly popped down stairs to check this and ask if we could sway our twin so that we had 3 interconnecting rooms. They quickly and kindly did this for us which was fantastic as my brohter could put his little boy to bed and then sit in the middle room to watch tv - they could also pop over to the north terminal for a coffee whilst we kept watch. Cant understand why they didnt allocate us that room in the first place as it made total sense but they were kind enough to change it straight away on request.  Would def recommend as alwasy and will def stay again when flying from Gatwick.

This hotel is definitely among the best. The car park is a great asset, being attached to the hotel and FREE at weekends. Chilled fresh fruit water on entrance is a lovely welcome after a long journey. The stay were very helpful and pleasant. The position on the waterfront is lovely especially on a Sunday morning to stroll down. It is virtually opposite the Hippodrome so great if you are watching an evening show. You have plenty of cafes and eateries on your doorstep and the main shops only 5/10 mins walk away. Our room was overlooking the waterfront and was lovely. Nicely decorated with everything you need including robes, slippers and water. Free internet is available but as a plug in so not so good for iphones. Great flat screen tv. The room was lovely and warm and we didnt experience any noise from the harbour. The walls did seem a little thin especially where the interconnecting door was but our neighbours were fine. Breakfast was really nice, we had it in our room and there was no tray charge which was impressive. Didnt have time for the afternoon tea but looked really nice. Having a live pianist in the river room on a sunday morn was a really nice touch. Would def recommend this hotel to anyone- very impressed.

Our room was spacious and well outfitted with a river view on the 4th floor (great for lounge access as it&acute;s just down the corridor).  The staff were great as usual and very attentive, especially in the lounge. As we had a late flight out that was delayed further we were given late checkout and allowed to spend the afternoon in the lounge for afternoon tea etc.  The evening cocktails are excellent and could pass as a dinner for some. We went out most nights afterwards but could easily have eaten more if we wanted. One major benefit of this lounge over those at other hotels is the variety of drinks available during the cocktail hour including Moet and a range of cocktails from a menu (cocktails are less common in Singaporean hotel lounges than other SE asian locations).  Breakfast in Town restaurant was exceptional and had a wide variety, including roti prata.

On first entering the hotel, it is an imposing sight, oozing character. Check-in was simple and staff were professional and helpful. We had a club room, which had a large bed and quality amenities. The welcome chocolates were a nice touch also.  The club lounge is excellent, with a great assortment of food and drink on offer, as well as offering a champagne breakfast. Staff are very attentive and helpful.  The breakfast buffet is enormous and very tasty. Although you have your wits about you as they seem to run out of food as soon as they restock it- it&acute;s that good!  The hotel&acute;s restaurants and bars seem great, although we only had time to sample the Post bar drinks (cocktails were very nice) and the Lighthouse restaurant.

Get B&B if you can, the buffet in the main restaurant is so good but not very good value if not included in the room rate. There&acute;s a good choice of food for vegetarians in Hong Kong and the hotel restaurants all have vegetarian items. It&acute;s in a central location - a couple of minutes walk from star ferry and MTR and surrounded by loads of shops and restaurants. I knocked a star off location because it doesn&acute;t have harbour views. I don&acute;t normally care about views but it would be nice to wake up to hong kong harbour! There&acute;s not much they can do about this as they can&acute;t move the hotel, and they make up for it in other ways - like the amazing scent they have throughout the hotel, it is the best smell in the world! We stayed in a grand langham room, which has a shuttered window in the bathroom, which is nice to watch TV in the bath. The rooftop pool is nice too, though quite small for proper swimming.

Nothing has deteriorated, infact I feel that the service and hospitality has become even better, making every guest in the hotel feel very special. Every need of yours is met at The Leela. We were served absolutely amazing meals every day. The Chefs would personally visit us during breakfast and ask what cuisine we would like to have for lunch and dinner. The staff working in the restaurant and Library bar were extremely courteous and went over and above they&acute;re actual duties to make sure our requests were met. I cannot thank them enough, as thanks to the whole staff at this splendid hotel, our 4 night stay as a family was just perfect. I cannot actually think of a single thing to complain about. The manager also came to meet us personally on day 1 and asked us to let him know if we required anything throughout our stay. The rooms as always were exceptionally clean and kept. My husband and I were in a suite, which had the most amazing view of the lake. The smallest things in the bathroom were kept with precision and every time I returned back to my room, it had been cleaned and re-organized.

If you are looking for a hotel which makes you feel like royalty, this is the place to come to. The days can be spent leisurely by the pool, where cold towels, refreshments and chilled fruits are served frequently courtesy of the hotel, or in the spa, or just relaxing in the magnificent gardens. The evenings begin with a drink in the plush library bar, which can be taken out into the courtyard to experience traditional rajasthani folk dance and music. Dinner is served inside or outdoors, and the menu is vast. Every palate will be satisfied over and over. The hotel staff, be it the concierge or the waiters cannot do enough to keep you happy, even arranging a shawl for my daughter one chilly evening!!

2025,422,Hotels,11/6/2009,FANTASTIC HOTEL- WELL WORTH A VISIT,"We stayed at the Townhouse during September to arrange and attend family funeral. We have looked for many years for a nice hotel in the Borders and found this via tripadvisor. We were travelling with other family members includin my elderly in-laws who dont normally travel. Our first question when making the reservation was if he could have his meals in his room as he is virtually deaf. I was reassured that this would be no problem. The hotel is very small but very very friendly and immaculate. Cehck-in was quick and easy and our rooms was amazing We stay in large 5 star hotels normally but the size, decor of both the room and the bathroom was the best I have experienced. The modern decor has been complemented by all the necessary amenties that are cleverly hidden around the room. The breakfast was second to none, there were many quite areas for us to sit as a family and to receive guests such as the vicar conducting the funeral. Staff where always on hand to help with anything we needed, such as a computor to type out some info for the event and when my father in law was taken ill contact a doctor and was able to advise us what to do and where to go. Melrose is a beautifull quaint little town well worth a trip to. Parking was either just outside the hotel or over the road at their sister property. The Bistro was great.

1963,422,Hotels,10/27/2015,Luxurious and relaxing,"Having stayed in Orlando many times before we always try and find somewhere different. We wanted close to Disney but not in Disney so thought Bonnet Creek would be a good option. We were not disappointed. The hotel is, as expected, very grand and luxurious. Valet parking was quick and efficient along with check-in so we were quickly in our room. The room was huge, settees, tables, chairs, pure luxury. However, we quickly realised that there was a funny buzzing noise that would clearly keep us up. We realised it was the fridge. After a couple of visits from an engineer they decided to just change it for a new one and all was sorted. A very kind lady kept calling from reception to check everything had been sorted to our satisfaction, which it was. The pool area was amazing, spacious, plenty of sunbeds, towels , sun bed covers, iced water, food and drinks service and the pool was just amazing. so so warm. It was especially nice at night for a late swim and them dry off in front of one of the fire pits whilst having a drink. The area is lovely as you can walk or ride around the bonnet creek area and visit the hiltons lazy river which we did. The hilton also has a 24 hour coffee/snack shop and a disney shop which was brilliant and the only thing the Waldorf misses. One thing to be prepared for is that the food and drink is very expensive. However, it is a 5* in a prime area so as long as your prepared then its understandable. The hotel is linked to the Hilton by a massive convention centre so it does sometimes have a more business feel but we didn&acute;t mind as it made the pool less busy. I would definitely recommend anyone who wanted tranquillity and luxury very close to Disney.",5,0,100,Waldorf Astoria Orlando,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34515-d1389861-Reviews-Waldorf_Astoria_Orlando-Orlando_Florida.html,Orlando,6

4193,ASK_THE_LEYLANDS,Hotels,7/10/2010,"YES, I DID IT AGAIN!","Booked our family holiday in Queensland at Ashmore Palms and we loved every minute of our stay once again!! 2nd time around....our family with two younger children and one adult child (20), stayed in the Cactus Cabana cabins, which were excellent. Close to the pool these are modern cabins with all that you could ever require, microwave, full size fridge (small milk provided), playstation, two t.v.&acute;s, two sofas one bunk and single bed in bedroom one, and queensize bed in bedroom two, No need to pack your hairdryer...inbuilt one in main bathroom along with complimentary bathroom products to get you through until you buy some essentials. The park is happy to allow Coles online shopping to deliver to your cabin, which is exactly what we did and they delivered about 8.00am on our first morning there with all our breakfast, bathroom, drink & snack supplies (no time wasted supermarket shopping!) we purchased online at home prior to leaving on holidays. The children had fun the heated pools and absolutely enjoyed spending time at the morning activities provided for them with Macca Macaw, particularly the sand art. The other families were at the park during our stay were easy to talk to, and my children found it very easy to find someone to play with. The staff are friendly and helpful, so ask them anything... where to eat?, directions? they always have great suggestions. Ashmore palms is a lovely place to stay, so close to the freeways and theme parks, yet out of the hustle and bustle & noisy nightlife that can keep you awake in surfers, it is a beautifully well maintained, peaceful, park indeed.

4200,ASK_THE_LEYLANDS,Hotels,6/15/2009,"Gorgeous surroundings, Extremely clean, Home comforts, Absolutely loved staying here!","Our family of 5 absolutely loved staying at Ashmore Palms for two weeks in May 2009. We booked the Macaw Mansion (a two storey townhouse with huge spa bath) which overlooks the beautiful lush green palms and lovely swimming pools. The whole park is well maintained and extremely clean and just absolutely beautiful to stroll around. The kids had a wonderful time visiting the macaws, huge onsite playgrounds, tennis courts and the kids club which is on every morning with loads of entertaining activities to keep them busy. There were stainless steel BBQS with hoods, situated around the park which are immaculately/sparkling clean for guests to use should they wish to cook and dine outside. Upon entering the mansions you first notice a CLEAN fresh fragrance, they are kept in a neat and tidy state with two sofas in living area, six chair dining setting, t.v. & dvd player, full size fridge in kitchen, oven, microwave, hotplates, all utensils you could ever need, (even a coffee plunger!), matching crockery! (none of that crappy mix match stuff), egg cups!, there was even paper towel, glad wrap and alfoil in the cupboard!. The bedroom downstairs had two sets of bunk beds, and main bedroom upstairs had a huge master bed... i&acute;m guessing probably was a queen or king size. Both bedrooms had sliding door built in robes, built in digital alarm clocks (very handy!), the pillows were EXTREMELY soft and comfy which is definately why I also enjoyed my stay, i&acute;ve slept on many that are like concrete slabs but the beds here were very easy to sleep in and made the stay enjoyable, no backaches or stiff necks here! (warning about the timber venetian blinds in upstairs master bedroom..... make sure you close them the right way, otherwise with the light on in master bedroom at night, you can see directly up into the room!!) The bathrooms both had HUGE shower recesses, and were 5 STAR clean with all towels, floor and handtowels provided, toiletpaper and tissues. Built in hairdryer in both upstairs and downstairs bathrooms. There was an upstairs balcony leading from the master bedroom, with outdoor setting. Both upstairs and downstairs had heating/cooling. The master bedroom had T.V., DVD, Mico stereo system (great!) , and AUSTAR included. The master bedroom also had his/hers bathrobes provided with spa. The park definately lives up to its fabulous reviews on trip advisor, and this is the reason why we chose to visit Ashmore Palms and we were not disappointed. The staff are lovely and welcoming. This is most definately a wonderful park for families. My children had a lovely time and made friends and had fun with other young families visiting the park. Upon checkout they gave us a bag of minties to chew on the plane flight back, and about a week after returning we received a post card from them, thank us for our stay, & welcoming us back. This was our first holiday ever to QLD and just the best place we have ever stayed anywhere, so when we visit again we will DEFINATELY choose to stay only at Ashmore Palms. Ashmore is only around 20-30 mintues from majority of theme parks. For cheap east near Ashmore Palms was Maries Pizza on Southport Nerang Rd ASHMORE, its just around the corner and tasted great. Chooky&acute;s Chicken, Salad & Cavery was also in same block of shops & had great roast dinner takeway for around $10.00. Thanks Ashmore Palms for a great stay, your park is lovely and just absolutely beautiful, your staff are so helpful and friendly, you are to be praised on your fantastic business, well done.",5,1,101,Ashmore Palms Holiday Village,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g658992-d599149-Reviews-Ashmore_Palms_Holiday_Village-Ashmore_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html,Ashmore,8
25152,DaisyFred,Hotels,11/1/2014,Simply perfect - Grazie Mariaelena!,"I reviewed B&B Guerrazzi 2 years ago so I won&acute;t bore you with the same details again suffice to say that I booked my return visit to Pisa around availability of this beautiful apartment. It&acute;s worth mentioning that nothing has changed - it&acute;s been as wonderful 2nd time around. So many new places start off well, trying to impress at the beginning and then start to &acute;lose it&acute; once they&acute;ve gained a foothold in the market. B&B Guerrazzi is not one of those places. It&acute;s as great now as it was then. Please, please, please just trust me and stay here. Many people see Pisa as an overnight visit or a quick half-day tour to be done on the way to somewhere else bit it shouldn&acute;t be the case. Yes, the main draw is the tower and if time is limited then that&acute;s most likely why you&acute;re here but, if you can spare a little more time, then try and linger for a couple of days at least. It&acute;s such a peaceful, pretty and friendly place that extra time spent here is well worth it. Anyway, this isn&acute;t a Pisa review but I guess it&acute;s got under my skin aided and abetted by B&B Guerrazzi. I simply can&acute;t stay anywhere else. Believe me, I tried (only because there was no availability here for our last night in Tuscany) and other places just don&acute;t come close. Home made breakfast, value for money, A/C, location, cleanliness, friendliness, free wifi, soundproof windows, &acute;blackout&acute; shutters, private patio (in no particular order), etc etc etc....the importance of some of these facilities won&acute;t necessarily register until you&acute;ve had to go without them and the great thing is, at this b&b, you won&acute;t have to. Mariaelena totally deserves the number one spot for all her hard work and I hope she goes from strength to strength. I&acute;m already looking at flights for next year to come back for a third time (and I rarely return somewhere twice nevermind 3 times) Please excuse my Italian but.....assolutamente perfetto!",5,1,101,B&B Guerrazzi,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187899-d1818848-Reviews-B_B_Guerrazzi-Pisa_Province_of_Pisa_Tuscany.html,Pisa,8
25162,DaisyFred,Hotels,10/22/2012,Bellissimo!,"Apologies now if this is a long review and I can only reiterate what has been written previously. I booked Pisa as a base for my 6 night break to the area based purely on the reviews for this b&b and I certainly wasn&acute;t disappointed. Being a female travelling alone I wanted somewhere safe and well located as well as my usual requirements (i.e. clean with a private bathroom). All needs were met and surpassed! I was collected from the airport by Alberto and within 10 minutes we were at the b&b. The apartment is on the 1st floor so I felt even more safe and I was lucky that Alberto carried my not so light case upstairs :-) Having been shown the various amenities - satellite tv, laptop, bathroom, terrace etc - a map was provided and Alberto had recommendations for restaurants etc. which were thorough and easy to find and I was then left to unpack and relax. There&acute;s a wine list in the apartment as well and I tried the white and a Chianti whilst I was there, both of which were very good. Later on both Mariaelena and Alberto returned with homemade bread and cakes for breakfast and even went to the trouble of having dinner delivered for me. Being on my own I wasn&acute;t feeling so confident about going out to find somewhere on my own on the first night. So, dinner and wine sorted, I was able to relax immediately! I&acute;ll do a trip report at a later date but back to the apartment itself.....the bedroom is huge, loads of wardrobe space, beautifully decorated, large bathroom with hairdryer and toiletries. The breakfast/living area is very comfortable with plenty of light and a sofa to relax on whilst planning the next day&acute;s activities. There&acute;s a microwave, small but adequate sized fridge, panini toaster and coffee machine. Also provided : bottled water, juice, lemons (love the proper lemons you get in Italy!), milk, fruit, choice of cereals, fruit teas, plenty of instant coffee, hot chocolate, croissants, homemade cookies and yoghurt as well as delicious homemade bread and cakes. You certainly won&acute;t go hungry with breakfast! There&acute;s air conditioning which I didn&acute;t use but can imagine would be very welcome in the summer months. There are huge double windows which can be fully opened. This may be a strange comment to make but, personally, I hate places where you can&acute;t have fresh air as the health and safety brigade seem to dictate you can only open a window by an inch in case someone falls out? I understand the safety aspect of this and I realise it most likely applies to large hotel chains but an individual&acute;s commonsense should be allowed to prevail. Anyway, now I&acute;m off my soapbox, what else? A relaxing terrace with comfortable seating as well as a large table and chairs, tasteful &acute;shades&acute; for the sun or rain, an olive tree, small lemon tree, flowers, ferns, lanterns etc. For once, the pictures of B&B Guerrazzi are real although even they don&acute;t do justice to the outside area and the apartment itself - the reality is even better. Pisa Centrale is a 10 minute stroll away. Come out of the apartment, turn right and a 2 minute walk away is a supermarket with anything you may need. If you&acute;re hungry but don&acute;t want to go too far then pay a visit to L&acute;Alba Rossa on Via Carlo Cattaneo, 12 which is the restaurant you can see from the apartment windows overlooking Via Francesco da Buti. The welcome is warm and the food is delicious and inexpensive. Do also pay a visit to Giardino Scotto which is practically on your doorstep - it may not be large but it does seem to be a hidden oasis where you can just chill and enjoy the surroundings and get away from the &acute;tourists&acute; of which we are of course. To sum up this long review then.......forget hotels whatever star they may be, don&acute;t feel like you have to be in the centre of things as B&B Guerrazzi is close to anything you may need, it&acute;s spotlessly clean, you&acute;ll be treated as a friend and it has all you need to enjoy a visit to this wonderful area of Tuscany. This place is more than a b&b or a &acute;home away from home&acute;, it&acute;s an experience you should have and, if you can, allow more than one night.....you&acute;ll feel all the better for it!",5,1,101,B&B Guerrazzi,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187899-d1818848-Reviews-B_B_Guerrazzi-Pisa_Province_of_Pisa_Tuscany.html,Pisa,8

Very nice room, not too big, but the view and decoration were great. We decided to upgrade to a poolvilla after 2 days. We kept on comparing the regular room to the villa, where we spent our holiday last year, and although our room and its location were nothing to complaint about, we decided to move towards the villa section of the resort. And it was worth the extra money again. Stylish villa, own pool, quiet location, outdoor shower and bath, comfortable bed and club service.

The villa is nicely decorated, comfortable beds and very nice shower products. Even suntan lotion is provided. The pool and villa are cleaned very well daily. Staying at a villa or suite means you have access to The Club. Very nice extra. Breakfast, high tea, cocktail hour, refreshments and snacks. Something to look forward to. Not the least because of the staff of The Club. We loved our stay that much that we decided to book an extra week. Two instead of one.

Our arrival was very welcoming with a refreshing lemon grass drink, cold towels and personal guidance towards our room. The Centara Resort is a big resort containing 3 swimming pools (extra one at villa area), gym, several restaurants, kids club, tennis courts. Set in beautiful gardens, buildings in colonial style (staff dressed in traditional uniforms too). The staff make you feel welcome every second of your stay! The waiters at The Club who took their time for a personal conversation and showing their interest;Nina at the front desk who greeted you by your name; the staff at the pool who prepared your sun beds with towels and came by with fresh fruit and cold towels. On the day of my birthday in the afternoon I as treated on a birthday muffin and champagne while the waiters at the club were singing Happy Birthday. In the evening a best wishes card from the general manager and a delicious chocolate cake was waiting in our room. It made me feel very special! Our daughter went horseback riding every day on the beach. The beach is long and not very crowded and very suitable for a good ride. Just outside the resort is a nice massage salon called first star which we visited regularly. Plenty of restaurants in the direct area, walking distance to shops and night market.

She was wonderful, extremely knowledgeable, and made the tour very enjoyable. Ariana was full of information about the food we tasted along the way, but she also gave us lots of additional information about the history of the neighborhoods we visited, which made the walking tour not only a food tasting tour, but also an architectural-historic tour of a few neighborhoods. It is worth pointing out that all the places where we stopped are locally owned businesses, so these are the real deal. If it had not been for this tour and Ariana&acute;s information, we would have missed a lot. Definitely recommend it. By the way, the walking part is not a big deal at all. It is done at a very nice easy pace and it should be fine for almost everybody. However, you should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time!!

We managed to get a table outside although the ambience (closed shop, litter and depressing looking shop fronts) was rather lacking. Despite this the food was absolutely 5/5, well presented and one of the most favourite places I have ever eaten. Great place to visit give it a go, my non-veggie friend really enjoyed it too! Price for a set meal ??19.95 was excellent value and with great cocktails to help wash down the food.

Also, the staff&acute;s English is not great, but it&acute;s passable. We were able to communicate but with some occasional difficulties. The hotel has a no tipping policy, which is very nice. More hotels should do that.  It was nice to have the mall connected so that we could do some Christmas shopping. Room service was good, better than most hotels.  The gym was not as good as we expected from photos on the website. It&acute;s a good gym for a hotel, but not a great gym.

She offered different solutions to accommodate our family. Even thought I used my Hilton Honor points for our stay, we were treated respectfully as regular paying customers. We got two rooms side by side with a perfect Empire building view, as well as discount parking. I appreciate her effort because the whole building was sold out during our stay.  We stayed at the Element at an unbeatable Travel Zoo rate before we moved into the Hampton Inn(they are next to each other on the same street). The Element was newer with a kitchen, but only offered one King-size bed so the primary customers are adults. Hampton Inn, in the other hand, is more family-friendly. The breakfast at Hampton Inn is better and has more variety than the one at Element. We did not have a problem finding seating as we had at the Element. My only complaint is that the elevator opens to narrow hallways which, caused traffic jams in the morning as the all the guests were either heading for the breakfast or checking out. Although it is located at the city center, it is quiet day and night.

Unfortunately no traditional evening cookies are offered at this hotel. Room is very clean and quiet. We reported a problem of the bathroom bulb.

HIE now provides wi-fi access in all rooms, as well as in all public areas, without imposing any charges in addition to the regular room rate. I congratulate them for this. Wi-fi is now indispensable for me while traveling, and I resent paying anything for wi-fi. I will not stay at any hotel which does not include wi-fi in the basic room rate. The wi-fi signal at this IHE and the speed were the best I??™ve had in any hotel anywhere.  2. The hotel continues to be meticulously maintained. Nothing is marred, dirty or left unrepaired.

The neighborhood, while not atmospheric, has all the conveniences and services I needed within one block of the hotel. The hotel itself is four years old and has all the advantages of a new facility, which I appreciated. My room was small, but very well thought out and arranged; I lacked for nothing. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was remarkably generous. . Because of some street noise, which was not extreme, I did ask to have my room changed from one facing Finchley Road to a room facing the car park, and it turned out to be very quiet.

Also the tube station, which is a 2 minute walk, has 3 different lines that cover all of London without the need to change trains.

We had 3 adults and 1 teen and there was enough room for us and our luggage. Sink area was small and not private (outside the shower/bath door). Coffee pot in room. Friendly staff.

22765,Colatown,Hotels,4/8/2013,Serenity in Venice,"I would have liked to have spent more than two nights at the Hotel Le Isole. The location is perfect for a first trip to Venice, when you want to be close to Piazza San Marco and the museums. We took the vaporetto from the train station to the San Zaccaria stop and had no trouble finding it from the directions, even though their website directions may confuse a right turn and a left turn at some point. (Or maybe we were the ones who were confused.) It&acute;s not far to go with rolling luggage, but there is a bridge you cross that has steps. However, in the hotel, there is an elevator if you need one.  The hotel is impeccably clean and the breakfast is excellent. They will prepare eggs fresh and also espresso, cappuccino, etc.The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very nice and had a bathtub, which you don&acute;t always get. Everything we needed was there, including a hair dryer. Our room (211) looked over the interior courtyard and was very quiet. Although it was small, it was well designed and there were two comfy chairs and a coffee table for having a snack in your room. They also included a water kettle and instant tea and coffee, if you don&acute;t want to wait until you go downstairs. The only drawback, although a slight one, was the wi-fi. It is free, but we kept having to log back in.

11620,Badlydrawngirl,Hotels,8/23/2013,"Charming, old-fashioned hotel","Looking for a cheap place to stay in central San Francisco, we were happy to find the Mayflower hotel. The location is very good, between Union Square and Nob Hill.  It??s an old hotel with about 100 rooms. The lobby, breakfast room and the lounge with PCs, books and sofas are quite nice. Of course, it??s not luxurious or perfect, but still quite charming.  We arrived quite early and could check immediately. We had a double room on the first floor. It was a big and quiet room with a small kitchenette and a large walk-in closet with ironing board. The decor seemed quite dated, cleanliness was okay. The bathroom was quite small and seemed very old, but everything worked well. There is not very much storage space and no hair dryer (you can borrow one from the reception).  We enjoyed that the hotel offered complimentary breakfast. There was a good choice of food: toast, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, jam, oatmeal, fruit, apple sauce, coffee and juice plus a nice selection of sweet stuff: scones, muffins, cake and shortbread (this stuff actually seemed to be homemade!). I liked the fact that they had real plates and mugs and not only disposable tableware.  The cleaning staff and reception staff were always very friendly, except from one reception worker who always seemed to be in a bad mood.  I??d definitely book the Mayflower Hotel again. Of course there may be better hotels in SF, but I think it would be difficult to find a place with better value.",5,1,101,Hotel Mayflower,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d501344-Reviews-Hotel_Mayflower-San_Francisco_California.html,San Francisco,8

10577,B-Abroad,Hotels,8/15/2011,A most enjoyable holiday!,"We stayed at Sovestro for 7 nights in July/August, and I have absolutely no hesitation in endorsing all the positive reviews already posted. Although officially 3 star, this was probably one of the most pleasant hotel experiences we have ever had....totally relaxing, we felt so comfortable and at home. The complimentary bottle of local wine was a lovely touch and very much enjoyed. The bedroom was spacious, clean and comfortable. The bathroom didn&acute;t have a bath, but was modern with a powerful shower and lots of hot water. We loved the lovely breakfast buffet on the terrace, and our room was always very promptly serviced while we were at breakfast. The pool was brilliant, and the atmosphere in the garden and pool area was always relaxed and peaceful.....no blaring music, no mad scramble for sunbeds, an oasis of calm after a day of sightseeing, we loved that pool! We appreciated the quiet location of our room, on the first floor, looking towards the second pool. we always had the afternoon sun on our balcony. I know some people have recommended rooms overlooking the main pool, but I think we had more privacy. The location of this hotel is perfect. We hired a car and visited Florence, Sienna, Volterra, We organized a wine tour (Chianti and Brunello) through the hotel, and not only tasted (and bought) some very fine wine, but it provided a great guided tour of the region, and we were picked up and delivered back to the hotel. One of our favourite things was the lovely walk along the old road to San Gimignano. It passes through vineyards, olive groves and orchards, and provides one of the very best views of this beautiful old town. Uphill all the way, and I wouldn&acute;t recommend walking back home after dark, but we walked into town at some point most days and really enjoyed it. We ate at some very fine restaurants in the town, but to be honest Da Pode was really as good as any of them, with the advantage of not having to make your way back to the hotel. Next time we visit, I think we will use Da Pode more. That&acute;s all! We had a fantastic holiday in this very beautiful part of Italy and will return next year. I hope we can book Hotel Sovestro again.",5,0,100,Hotel Sovestro,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187901-d551151-Reviews-Hotel_Sovestro-San_Gimignano_Tuscany.html,San Gimignano,8

It was even more amazing when I arrived. The hotel staff is very accommodating, from the GM to the shuttle driver, all very nice and pleasant. The concierge was of great help also, saving me money by recommending the train into the city instead of paying 10 dollars for the water taxi. I never had an issue with the shuttle, given the amount of runs it makes between terminals, grocery, train and hotel. My longest wait was maybe six minutes coming from the train station. The views on either side of the hotel are beautiful, so either room is a great choice. Noise outside of the hotel was very minimal, with the exception of the ferry horn that goes off whenever it leaves. The room was very clean and organized, bathroom nice and tidy also.

Every room has a balcony...our also faced the bay and piers so we were very happy with our surroundings... The room had a very nice, clean feel about it...the bed was huge and faced the balcony allowing some beautiful morning views. Keep in mind, the hotel is huge....the walk from the glass enclosed elevator to the room took about 5 minutes...the hotel has a 70&acute;s feel to it, imagine the monorail in Disney...The lobby has to be seen in person, rows and rows of lights suspended from the ceiling...I believe I read the lobby is int he Guinness book of records for being the largest lobbies. We took in a Giants game and although it took us a good 30 minutes to get to the stadium, the walk was along the water and we got to walk under the bay bridge! We took public transportation back, and public transport is everywhere and easy to navigate. 1 block from the Piers, there is an abundance of eateries available....just outside the hotel was a farmer&acute;s/craft market. An open plaza serves as a stage for just about anything you can think of. There was a squash tournament nearby, we took a minute to watch and we were glad we did. Rented bikes and took a ride to Fisherman&acute;s Wharf-what a wise choice! There is a bike rental just outside the hotel. We parked in the garage across from the hotel-we walked through an office building to get to the hotel-odd setup, but somehow we managed! We got breakfast from the hotel to go and enjoyed it on the balcony. To-go service was above and beyond....we both got oatmeal and the serving size was large and the accompaniments were yummy-nuts, fruit, creme.....their coffee and tea service set up just outside the lobby restaurant is overwhelming!

Two years on I still rate this as one of my top London hotels! It&acute;s the small touches that count in my opinion - evening turn down service is excellent with new towels if needed and slippers placed at the bedside (I particularly liked the way my &acute;stray&acute; toiletries were neatly placed on clean linen cloths in the bathroom), spotlessly clean rooms and bathroom, Elemis toiletries, padded coathangers, &acute;proper&acute; hairdryer, tea / coffee in the room (hotels that don&acute;t supply this really irritate me), iron and board ... my only gripe is that breakfast service could be a bit slicker - supplying tea / coffee, toast and clearing / relaying tables quickly really isn&acute;t that difficult a job is it? Haven&acute;t tried the Spa (looks a bit pricy) or the laundry service.

7490,Andrea63,Hotels,4/5/2015,Maintained and Sustained Excellent Service,"This is my second stay at this property. I stayed last year while in transit and I am very pleased with the consistency in service and quality of this property. My satisfying experience started while waiting for the free hotel shuttle service at Terminal 3. I got to the shuttle service counter 10 minutes after the shuttle left. The shuttle service coordinators (Teejay and Anthony) were so nice and accommodating. Teejay offered to get me a drink upstairs in the departure area so I don&acute;t have to leave the counter. It was so thoughtful and appreciated after a long tiring flight-the weather was so humid and the ice cold can of soda that Teejay got was just perfect. The shuttle arrived 20 minutes later and they efficiently loaded my luggage. The shuttle&acute;s AC was so cold and the ride to the hotel took less than 15 minutes. There is a security check prior to entering the hotel and luggage were checked as well. I was greeted with a warm smile and welcoming greeting by the front desk associate. Check-in took 5 minutes and my luggage was delivered to my room. The room was clean, with the same amenities as I remembered from my prior visit. Strong hot water pressure shower was great after a long haul flight. AC temperature was perfect. I had a great night&acute;s sleep. Room service was timely and food quality is excellent. The shuttle service back to the airport was seamless. Just be at the lobby 10 minutes before the hour. Overall, a five star experience and will definitely stay at this property again.",5,3,103,Manila Marriott Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298452-d1536444-Reviews-Manila_Marriott_Hotel-Pasay_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,Pasay,8
7500,Andrea63,Hotels,3/22/2014,Wish I could have stayed longer!,"Stayed for one night while in transit and really love this property. I have been to numerous Marriott properties all over the World and the amenities and environment in this property is comparable, and the service superb. Here&acute;s why: 1. Valet service was prompt and polite. They took care of our luggage with care. 2. Check-in was flawless. We were greeted as soon as we entered the lobby and directed to the front desk. Professional, friendly service with a smile- genuine, personalized greeting. It reminded me of Ritz Carlton. Lobby was spotlessly clean. There&acute;s an ATM in the lobby for last minute needs. 3. Rooms were clean and huge, with a nice view of the pool and what looks like a golf course. AC temperature perfectly controlled. The shower is separated from the toilet with a glass door. There is a tub and a rain shower that was just lovely after a long flight. The bathroom is separated by a glass wall (I did not really like it at first) but there is a screen for privacy. Beds were comfy with clean, crisp sheets. 4. Ample amenities- robes, slippers, toothbrush, razor and other vanities provided. 5. A big box of tea as a welcome gift. Really surprised about this since I only experienced receiving gifts from Marriott&acute;s Luxury Collection properties. 6. The mall that is connected to the hotel was a treat. Restaurants and shopping galore. 7. Security presence is huge in the hotel. And, the best part is the service they provided above and beyond. My husband was feeling under the weather and we wanted to seek medical help before a long journey/early flight. The concierge contacted a clinic in the hotel vicinity. A bell man escorted us to the clinic and waited for us until the consultation is finished. A doctor came within 3 mins. and took care of my husband, What a joy and relief. The concierge sent another bellman to fill the prescription, and delivered the medicine to our room. All our needs were conveniently taken cared of. I felt like we had our own personal assistant that night. The business center gal was so pleasant, courteous and considerate. There is an internet fee and fee for printing boarding passes. I inadvertently printed colored copies (extra charges apply) and told her my mistake. She charged me for B/W since it was a mistake. Also, using the internet for 5 minutes is free (just enough time to check in and print boarding passes). There is a Resorts World bus that shuttles to and from the airport every hour for free. Just be at the lobby 10 minutes before the hour. I will definitely stay here again and hopefully, longer next time.",5,0,100,Manila Marriott Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298452-d1536444-Reviews-Manila_Marriott_Hotel-Pasay_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,Pasay,8
10569,B-Abroad,Restaurants,4/23/2014,Good Experience,"We ate at market Lane on Easter Sunday night. They dont take bookings for smaller parties, and the restaurant was bustling, but we didn&acute;t have to wait too long before Michelle, the manager, showed us to our table. Our food was served promptly, by Daniel, who was friendly and efficient. I had a problem with my sirloin steak which was well done rather than the requested medium. (My husbands fillet was perfect). When I pointed this out, Daniel apologised without any hesitation or fuss, and took it away. It was replaced very quickly (perfectly medium this time), with a further apology from Michelle. I was more than happy with this response, but then the staff went beyond my expectations and provided complimentary Irish coffee and Baileys as further recompense. In my opinion, any restaurant can get it wrong with a steak, but it was the way the issue was dealt with that makes the staff at Market Lane outstanding. That&acute;s why I would return, and why I wouldn&acute;t hesitate to recommend this restaurant.

We particularly enjoyed the Peking duck, and their signature beef dish was sublime. We enjoyed ordering a number of dishes and sharing them, so we all tried everything. This is a pricy place, but we and our friends agreed that it was a worth-it vacation splurge. We found service to be helpful and friendly, and we weren&acute;t rushed as some reviewers have noted. We were there for late lunch, so that&acute;s probably why we had a different experience from the dinner crowd. The restaurant was nearly full, but our group of 7 had no wait at lunch time. I have visited Hong Kong, and the atmosphere here reminded me so much of that place. No windows, and with a lively crowd (translation: noisy), which is typical of Hong Kong restaurants. People in HK live in small apartments, with no room for entertaining, so restaurants are their living rooms, where they eat, laugh loudly, and socialize together. Don&acute;t expect a quiet meal.

We originally made a reservation at the Marriott O&acute; hare directly across from this hotel on the other side of the highway. We changed our reservation and stayed at the Renaissance instead since the Marriott had some construction going on within the pool/ whirlpool areas.The check in time was speedy and the front desk employees were all pleaseant and quite upbeat. The hotel has a very spacious, modern and inviting lobby area. Lots of leg room and some really comfortable sitting spots. Our room was unusually large in comparison to most hotels that I have stayed at within the same general area. The room was in very good and clean condition. The bed was very comfortable and the refrigerator in the room was a great addition to the ammenities and sure kept our beverages cold. The hotel has a really spacious swimming pool and a pretty nice whirlpool as well. My only complaint was the water temperature of the whirlpool was luke warm at best. I contacted the front desk and the temperature was much better later that day. It is nice to know that complaints and feedback do actually get taken care of quickly. Well anyways, this hotel is extremely convenient for travel to see a Cubs game. Wrigley Field is no more than 35 minutes away. The train station is less than a block away. It cost us $5 each for a pass to get us to and from the ballgame. The Bell Captain at the hotel gave us accurate diections by train and it turned out to be a great ballgame. Go Cubs!! I Make sure that you check out Ginos East for some super tasty Chicago style pizza. It is across the highway and maybe a 5 minute drive. My only complaints about this hotel would be as follows. The hotel is off a main road and there is no sign at the roadway itself. We drove right past it. There is a dark colored hotel sign at the actual entry. However, It is somewhat challenging to read and did not appear to be well lit. Unlike the other reviews, I expect and anticipate being charged to park my car at a hotel in the Chicago area. However, the parking structure is incredibly busy at times at the spaces are unusually narrow. Make sure that you are careful opening your doors. You don&acute;t want to hit the car next to you.

I never heard other guests though there were other suites occupied on the floor. I also did not experience any problems with the elevators until Saturday morning and even then the rush was only at breakfast. Four elevators serve the hotel so we never had much of a wait except going downstairs Saturday when several elevators stopped but were too full to admit us. The hotel was fully occupied for the weekend. Tuesday through Friday we had no problerm getting to breakfast and finding a table. Our group of four did not always eat at the same time or together and we all had no problems. We also found the food choices to be very nice. It varied on the days we were here--scrambled eggs were always available, but sometimes turkey canadian bacon, sausage or bacon. Sometimes a scramble and other times breakfast potatoes. Almost always french toast and pancakes, and waffle batter to make your own waffle. Oatmeal in crockpots, wide variety of cereals. Fruits varied by day, but in addition to the ever present apples and bananas were cut melon and berries. There were all sorts of pastries: muffins, sweet breads, croissants. There were english muffins, wheat bread, bagels of various types, yogurt, etc. There were hot teas and coffees. I can&acute;t imagine what more could be ordered that could be served in this sort of setting. Things were restocked regularly and the attendants were helpful. Therer are many rooms for sitting and eating. One has to explore a bit to find them all. I almost always snagged a table with a window view. There are also paper plates and bowls etc for taking food to your room. I greatly appreciated this as I did not have to juggle food as I have had to do in some other properties. The room itself had a fridge, microwave and dishwasher with coffeepot and all sorts of equipment--cutting board, knives and utensils plus plates and serving bowls, etc. Perfect for grabbing food at one of the great markets for in-room dining. The flat screen Tv tilts for viewing in bed or from sofa or from dining table. The small bathroom has a single sink, tub with shower. The water pressure and temperature was good. good lighting in bathroom. If I had to complain about anything it might be that with such a long stay another trash can or a bit larger waste basket would have been handy. Otherwise the room had everything needed including an in-room safe and multiple lamps and wifi capability--free! The staff was friendly. In the same block to the right when exiting the hotel is a Jim Horton/sThe Soup Man spot with delicious soups and sandwiches. They also serve doughnuts and frozen yogurt and ice cream. Across the street in the opposite direction is a PAX foods with lots of healthy choices. If you get in late you may find that Gabby O&acute;Hara&acute;s, an Irish pub just a half block down 39th is open--table service is fast and I recommend the burgers! One night we were tired and it was very late and they appeared to be the closest food service spot that was open. Food is served on the 3rd floor bar but they close rather early. The bar remains open later and the fare is somewhat limited, but certainly adequate for a meal. We had a lunch in Bryant Park on our first day--great spot for sunshine and people watching with good food from the &acute;wich vendor. It was an easy walk South to the Macy&acute;s at Herald Square or North and West to Times Square even for my 76 year old mom. I have stayed at the Fairfields and Courtyards in this same area and hands-down the Residence Inn is my favorite. I look forward to my next trip!",5,6,106,Residence Inn New York Manhattan/Times Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d578305-Reviews-Residence_Inn_New_York_Manhattan_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,8

After searching the internet, I once again turned to Tripadvisor for help. Cellini was no. 5 on the list of best hotels, so rang them to see if they had anything available. They had a triple room free for the nights I wanted so I went there to check it out before I booked. They are on the 3rd floor of an old building, but once you enter their doors its like stepping into a happy place. A lovely smell greets you along with Classical musical.

During breakfast/checkout time, the 3 elevators were constantly full and busy. The elevators themselves were very speedy, but the sheer amount of people wanting to move from 32 floors all the way to floor 1 caused a sort of gridlock during the morning.

On entering the lobby and reception area of the hotel, there is a distinct feeling of class.  I spent one night in this hotel, in December 2007. I had to queue a short time to check in, but check-in was smooth. The room rate did not include breakfast and I declined to pay the supplement for it, which was something like ??15 (a number of local coffee shops were open for breakfast at a more reasonable price, just a few steps outside the front door). I was allocated a single room - it was a long narrow room, with the bed spanning its width. The room was very nicely furnished in a contemporary style, as was the ensuite bathroom, and was equipped with a modern LCD TV with digital channels. My only real complaint about this room was that the base sheet did not properly fit the bed.  The room rate I paid was a little over ??70 and, although this did not include breakfast, I consider this to be excellent value for central London - it was worth paying the little extra over the typical ??50-60 for a London budget hotel, as the Strand Palace offered a sense of luxury and class that made my stay that much more pleasurable.

19603,Carltona,Hotels,9/2/2010,Just the right side of posh!,"Can&acute;t say enough nice things about this hotel. It is outstanding. I&acute;d had my eye on it for some time and so imagine my delight when my wife treated me to a stay for my 50th Birthday. Since we got home we have done nothing but rack our brains for a reason to go back. My wife doesn&acute;t do the internet and so booked over the phone months in advance with Simon. Did he rip her off on the price? No way. I thought she got a great deal. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with nothing but friendliness and hospitality; nothing was too much trouble. Simon had noted that it was a special occasion and the receptionist was able to honour his provisional promise of a room with a mews view. In our room there was a birthday card waiting for me and a note from the manager inviting us to take drinks in the bar - on him. What a nice treat that was - having a fancy pre-prandial staring at the Queen&acute;s house across the road! My wife said it was the best wine she had ever tasted and G/d knows she has drunk enough of it in her time. Actually got up early next morning to go for a walk to generate an appetitie for breakfast. Helped ourselves to a complimentary Starbucks from the lobby and strolled around the corner to look at Buckingham Palace from the front. So nice to be there before the crowds. Stupendous breakfast, cooked beautifully, superb service, timing perfect. Would love to dine in one of their restaurants. All too soon it was time to leave. We love that part of London - don&acute;t let the daytime scrum outside the station put you off. Walk around the corner to the hotel and it is a haven of tranquility, especially in the evenings. In fact the concierge will give you a Smartsave streetmap - it will get you 20% off food and drink at lots of restaurants including a very nice Bella Italia just opposite the station. I would repeat how fantastic the staff were, but also should give a mention to the other guests - they were lovely!! The hotel obviously trains its staff to the highest standards, but how so the people who choose to stay there?! Other than Simon, I could mention individual staff members by name but there are too many of them and it wouldn&acute;t be fair to those I missed out so I shall finish by saying well done to General Manager Malcolm Hendry and all of your staff.

30930,EricNYC10023,Hotels,6/25/2013,The Third Time&acute;s (even more of) A Charm!,"We just returned from our third trip to the St. Regis, and it was even more perfect than the prior two visits. We continue to choose this resort for it&acute;s idyllic setting, the spectacular service, and for the seclusion and solitude that, as professionals who continuously travel for work, we so desperately crave.  We arrived on a scorching Friday afternoon, met with two ice cold margaritas and familiar friendly faces that helped us to shred all stress, while taking us through perhaps THE MOST enjoyable check-in process of any hotel we&acute;ve visited (there&acute;s no reception desk, check-in takes place in comfortable chairs overlooking an infinity pool and the Pacific Ocean. Friday also brings the weekly champagne ritual, a tradition with roots in Napoleon&acute;s victorious battle celebrations. Now, I&acute;m not a huge drinker, but starting a vacation off with margaritas, followed by glass after glass of ice cold Veuve Clicquot, really sets the stage for the exceptional experience that follows...  We were shuttled off to, and met, at our room by Omar, our daytime butler. Together with Luis, our evening butler, our wants and needs were quickly addressed in a helpful, but never obtrusive manner. The butler experience has actually gotten better - in the past, we could expect being served by several butlers over a week&acute;s time. What&acute;s changed is consistency - the resort aims to have the same (daytime and evening) butlers catering to you for the duration of your stay. This way, relationships are established and they got to know what we liked, and anticipated our needs ahead of time.  While many guests choose to venture outside the resort, we did so only twice. The first was to dine at Sufi, an excellent seafood restaurant with an Italian influence that&acute;s highly recommended. The second time was to venture into the town of Punta Mita. While there&acute;s more of a true local experience in the town, we preferred to stay within the confines of the property. If you do go into town, try Casa Teresa. It&acute;s an excellent Italian restaurant in a very cool, unexpected setting.  At the resort, Carolina (the more formal restaurant), is a must visit. We were fortunate enough to be on vacation while they introduced an upscale, authentic Mexican menu (the usual fare is haute European) - it was excellent (twice), made more so by the availability of a humidor full of Cuban cigars (together with Armagnac, my perfect end to a spectacular evening)! Also consistently good are the casual Sea Breeze (breakfast and lunch) and Marietas (lunch) restaurants.  This St. Regis will always have a special place for us - my fiancee and I got engaged here, and coming back is like coming home.

1785,2toots,Hotels,4/19/2012,Never Fails to Impress,"My girlfriends and I had a wonderful 2 night stay at one of the greatest hotels in New York, The Waldorf. We were warmly greeted and courteously taken care of by Benito. Benito stored our bags for us until we checked in. I knew we were early, but started the check-in process with Tim at the Gold desk. We had brunch reservations and were in no rush to check-in. Brunch was spectacular--endless gleaming trays of lobster, shrimp, oysters, Beouf Wellington, Lamb, chicken..too much to mention. I had lobster Eggs Benedict..oh yummmm. Caviar, sushi, even the Waldorf Salad was on the buffet--sweet eaters will have their sugar fix with the gorgeous array of deserts, complete with chocolate fountain. Of course, we can&acute;t overlook our attentive waiter, Farhad and thank him for making us feel that this brunch was just for us, and never rushed us during our 3 hours at the table, yes 3 hours.... I am so glad Crystal completed my check-in process. Our room was just awaiting &acute;inspection&acute; so we ventured to the gift shop. I was so honored that Crystal found us in the gift shop and brought our keys to us, going out of their way must just be the norm for the Waldorf! By the time we got to the room, the bellhop was waiting for us. To our surprise it was Servando....oddly enough he had been our bellhop the last time we were there and made us feel like we were old friends of his. Our room was a mini-suite with a separate living room, pull out sofa, 2 bathrooms, 2 tv&acute;s. The room was our home for 2 days and we felt very comfortable. Our beds and pillows gave us all sweet dreams at the end of the night. Our second day began with a tour of Guerlain spa. Thanks to Veronica who showed us around, we were immediately smitten and we all booked a spa treatment on the spot. I booked the Imperial Massage with Anita, wow, relaxing to the max! Someone booked a pedicure with Rodica and loved it! Each massage suite has it&acute;s own shower, changing area and toilet....we all felt as though we could have spent the night in one of these suites! We enjoyed some champagne afterwards, which was such a treat! The Platinum martini at the Peacock Alley bar is worth a try. Try to get an extra blue cheese stuffed olive, they are delicious! Onto the Bull and Bear for dinner. I&acute;ve got to say our meal was plentiful, Porterhouse, onion rings, truffle fries, spinach....no matter how good a meal is, it&acute;s the experience that goes along with it that makes it extra ordinary..and we have Abdul to thank for that. He was the perfect server for us, he smiled a lot, was there when appropriate and even brought us cookies for desert! We were just about to walk down the stairs to leave the hotel when Benito was at the top taking our bags from us. What an honor to have the person who we first said hello to be the last person we said goodbye to. Waldorf, thank you, thank you for making us pumpkins feel like Cinderella&acute;s.

After reading some of the posts, it made me wonder if I was the only one to appreciate this landmark hotel. I took in all the glitz and glamor the hotel could offer. Our hallway was adorned with photos of those celebrities caught in the moment of being in the Ballroom, at dinner, and the likes. I wish I had more time to stroll the other hallways and gaze upon moments preserved forever. My daughter and I were in the city for one night, to attend a cooking demonstration at the Astor Center on E4th St. We were able to take the subway, just around the corner from the hotel, and be in the SOHO District in 10 minutes, and I think it only cost $4 for the round trip. We took the train into the city, so we didn&acute;t have to deal with driving/parking, because it is a nightmare! We were upgraded to a suite, offered a choice of continental breakfast or 2 cocktails at any of the 4 bars at the hotel and 2 bottles of water --being an Hilton Honors member does have it&acute;s priveldges :) Our 2 room suite was huge...a small entryway, large &acute;coat&acute; closet, fireplace in the living room area, another huge (7x5ft) walk in closet in the sleeping area. I felt extremely spoiled having the room we had..we were on the 9th floor of a 26 floor hotel. They do have a club level. Water pressure and temperature were just fine. 2 tv&acute;s, mini-bar (always outrageous prices with mini-bars, but they are fun to see what&acute;s in them!) We were at the end of the hallway so I never heard any noise...but being in the city is loud..constant traffic, horns, sirens, but that is all part of what makes NYC the best city in the world! NYC is expensive, so be prepared... We had drinks at the Peacock bar and just watched the world go by. Our drinks were complimented by 2 little dishes of marinated olives and espresso dusted almonds...thank you Nick and Michael for your attentiveness, you&acute;re great mixologists! Even at 10pm there were people, lots of people checking in, checking out, the front desk was always busy when we walked by, and we were there on a Monday. I loved hearing the clock chime.

The new play area behind the office and the park labyrinth opposite corner of the property certainly make it an interesting place although I would estimate about half the guests there are couples. Room cleanliness has improved noticeably over the years although there is an urgent need for a plumber and electrician. The bathrooms, in particular, need lots of work as they have been remodeled several times leaving gaping holes around the pipes, etc. Although the rooms look attractive when you first enter, you quickly realize the property still needs much work. There are no in-room safes here which is unfortunate. And speaking of unfortunate, the breakfast is hardly impressive.

Although it&acute;s a four slice model, it does not have independent baskets so all four slices (or two bagels) must be started at the same time. So if I come along after another guest has started to toast a bagel, I have to wait five minutes before I can toast mine. I&acute;ve stayed at hotels ranging from five star to the lowly Econo Lodge and haven&acute;t seen a more ill-suited toaster than the one here. Some hotels have commercial tractor feed models that move the bread over the hot coils and others have a less costly four or eight slice model but at least with independent baskets.

But if you depend on electronic communication, you may find that somewhat challenging. It&acute;s not that the wifi is slow, as some have reported, it&acute;s that the routers are located in the hallways and the signal does not penetrate well through the walls and steel doors. If you stand behind the door, you&acute;ll get a strong signal. But as you move toward the window, where the work table is located, the signal fades rapidly. It doesn&acute;t matter how many times the servers are upgraded, unless the signal strength of the routers can be greatly increased, or range extenders/repeaters are installed in the guest rooms, you&acute;ll find the signal to be marginal.  Conversely, your cell phone will work fine on the top (3rd) floor. But on lower floors, you&acute;ll need to get close to the window to get a good cell phone signal, again due to the structural nature of the building.

It does seem a little intimidating at times. And there&acute;s a three way race between the dispiritied breakfast attendants, the toaster or the elevator to see who/what hotds the title for slowest in the land. And speaking of breakfast, can anyone explain why the pitchers of cold milk are placed right next to the hot waffle machine?

Also bus 157 takes about 30 mins to bottom of La Rambla, waterfront and then goes on to beaches. Bus stop is just outside hotel. Trams about 5 mins walk connect with metro and local trains. Fares cheap - buy a T10 ticket at the tramstop and use it on all public transport.  hotel apartments are clean, comfortable and spacious. furnishings a bit tired and if you ask for stuff to do your own catering it is very basic but you can manage - just. our standard apartment comprised of living room with kitchenette, bathroom, and bedroom.

All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, from the breakfast manager to front desk staff and valet attendants. The location is fantastic, being completely walkable to all attractions in the downtown area. Previous reviews that say you have to take the shuttle to get to downtown are flat-out wrong (perhaps they meant to review the Homewood Suites Vanderbilt). One of the few drawbacks to this property is the self-parking situation. The garage is about two and half blocks away, making it a pain to walk uphill with luggage back to the hotel.

The state capital building was also within easy walking distance. The hotel made an excellent base to explore and was a high quality hotel, with a very large and clean room, nice check-in area, friendly staff, good business center (2 computers), and a nice eating area. Breakfast and the evening reception had very good selection and were well-maintained by the hostesses. The macaroni and cheese for supper was very good! We had a nice view toward downtown from our room. It was a little difficult upon arriving to the hotel since there wasn&acute;t any place to park and unload our luggage; we finally parked in near the bell stand area 1/2 a block away from the entrance. When we left the hotel, I had to pick the car up from the garage (several blocks away) and stop in the pay parking lot across the street and the others in the party walked the luggage across the street. One other small issue, which probably couldn&acute;t be avoided, is that the elevators and area around them had no security and weren&acute;t near the check-in desk; I did notice a camera pointing at the elevators and there was a secure door to get to the individual rooms. Although downtown was close, there was a small park a block away where it appeared homeless people stayed during the day and there was always a police car parked next to it during the day with two policemen.

There is a little cafe and restaurant attached to the hotel if you want food during your stay, along with additional room service.

In addition to table lamps, there were small reading lights and even an iPod dock on the bed side tables. A nice touch was complimentary bottled water, as well as the traditional tea and coffee making facilities. Even though we were on the top floor, our view was pleasant with nothing unsightly. There was an LCD TV which could be used for internet access as well as for freeview channels.

Heathrow Connect from LHR took 25 mins and then a 3-min walk from the station. Believe we got a slight upgrade to bigger rooms - they were fresh, inviting and comfortable. Nice bath amenities as well. Having seen our fair share of 4 or 4+ star hotels in London, this was really welcome. For us, it was a great combination/mix - a place you&acute;d look fwd to coming back to after a long day sightseeing, with comfy rooms, easy access to the Tube/bus, and 24-hr convenience and restaurants/bars next door. (ie, we didn&acute;t care that there was no cavernous lobby with chandeliers, porters, conf rooms, and facilities we&acute;d never use, etc) For us, this made more sense, with a small but helpful front desk (Francesca & team were great!).  Some improvement tips: a few in our group did try breakfast, which was apparently nothing to write home about (not helped by the fact that someone was mopping the floor while they ate). Also, in the spirit of minimalism, I didn&acute;t mind running down to the bar for ice, but they never had any available (!). Finally - and this is probably more a IHG corporate policy - when we paid the balance of our booking, the amount had been converted from UK pounds, but with a hefty 3-4% extra. We should&acute;ve been given the option of paying in pounds.  But all in all, a very pleasant stay, a great base and perhaps most of all, the right"""" mix of services and comfort-level that we&acute;d want to pay for.

The clientele varies in age group which makes it very nice for those of us who are a little bit more mature. The only reason for not giving 5 stars was the condition of the room. For the price, the room was quite acceptable although it certainly could have used a little investment. There&acute;s a humongous old CRT television and VCR from the 1980s. The floor is a hideous fake wood vinyl and my feet got a little dirty walking around barefoot.

We stayed in a first floor room in the preferred area on a B&B basis and standards were still as high as ever. The bedrooms and shower rooms are a bit dated, but are kept spotlessly clean and bed linen is changed regularly and towels daily and a daily visit by housekeeping in the evening checks that everything is ok. The aircon does it&acute;s job quietly and efficiently. Breakfast used to be served in the Orangerie, but this large restaurant is now reserved for the fully inclusive guests (mostly Russian) Breakfast for us was in the outside area of Seagulls restaurant (under cover but open to the garden on one side and cooled by ceiling fans, not aircon.) Althought the food was to the usual high standard, we had to go indoors, up and down steps to access the food areas and another set of steps for the drinks ... a bit difficult if you wear light-reactive specs and have trouble seeing the dark grey steps! Also, the salad, fruit and yoghurt selections were not kept in refridgerated shelves and were always cool but never really cold. The gardens are extensive and extremely well kept. There is a large area of beach reserved exclusively for J.V. clients and plenty of shade and very comfortable sunbeds, though there seemed to be early morning reserving of the prime site sunbeds with towels which became a bit annoying. We didn&acute;t use the swimming pool and it&acute;s terraces, but there was plenty of beds and everywhere was kept pristine. The real disappointment was the advertised &acute;free wifi&acute; which is new. It was only available in very limited areas and was very slow,in fact, almost non-existant most of the time. I enquired about paying for the wifi available in bedrooms. This was available by the hour (though once you&acute;ve logged on, the hour use has to be continual, there&acute;s no logging off and accessing the remaining time later; or by the day ... at an enormous cost ... I was quoted 230 EL which worked out at something like ??22. There&acute;s plenty of wifi advertised at bars and restaurants nearby and this was a much better option. We ate outside the hotel most of the time, but did have two meals at the hotel&acute;s Frigolino Italian restaurant. On both occasions the waiter got the order wrong! Some of our choices were good and some rated as only mediocre. There are different areas available for bedrooms, though all rooms are to the same standard. Our choice will always be upstairs in the &acute;preferred area&acute; to the left of the main walkway as you face the sea. Rooms in the preferred area are the most expensive, but well worth the extra.",4,1,100,Maritim Jolie Ville Resort & Casino Sharm El-Sheikh,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297555-d301826-Reviews-Maritim_Jolie_Ville_Resort_Casino_Sharm_El_Sheikh-Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_a.html,Sharm El Sheikh,0
24328,DBSA42,Hotels,12/9/2011,Great location right on the beach,"This was our sixth stay at the Maritim Jolie Ville, so that says a lot!. The rooms are spacious and thoroughly cleaned every day. The only downside in the accommodation is the tiling in the bathrooms; it&acute;s dated and in need of replacing, but the porcelaine and taps are in mint condition and there&acute;s lots of piping hot water. Towels and sheets are changed every day and the staff are excellent. There are three areas of accommodation, charged at three different rates. The Sports Area (cheapest) is located across a busy road and quite a distance from the pool and beach, next there&acute;s the Palms area, this is very close to the nightlife in Naama Bay, so if you&acute;re not a night owl, then you might find it noisy into the early hours. By far the best and most expensive area is The Preferred, situation on the East side of the complex. It&acute;s well worth paying to upgrade to here. The gardens are well tended and the walkways are washed down every day: the whole place is nipping clean. We went bed and breakfast and were very pleased with the buffet facilities at the Orangerie, where there was a huge choice of breakfasts, including an omelette bar where omelettes, pancakes, fried eggs etc. a done to order. There is an enormous pool with ample sun loungers and free towels. The private beach has very comfortable loungers and lots of shade, and again, free towels. Because of shark attacks in 2010, the hotel has installed anti-shark nets along the whole of it&acute;s long frontage: makes for safe swimming but the area is now empty of fish so snorkelling isn&acute;t at all interesting. Depends on what you want, but snorkelling the house reefs was a very enjoyable part of our holiday in previous years, so the nets were a big disappointment to us.

However, NJV Athens is still one of the top dogs in this row. The hotel appears to be well-established with staff being mature and hospitable but not as crisp and dynamic as the Hyatt or Marriott. I guess it is more of a traditional homely feel within a old 5* establishment.  Here&acute;s what counts: the rooms are quite spacious but the beds are too SOFT....I dread if I were to be over 100 kgs. And there was no kettle in the room with complimentary coffee/tea...surprising for a Euro 160 a night room. There is a fridge/minibar but no complimentary water either. Otherwise, the room had an old feel and being a low storey hotel, you often hear the street noise and traffic quite easily. There is a balcony that gives you a small clip view of Acropolis but nothing to shout about. Have to keep the curtains shut as the opposite building is very close.

Housekeeping remains the strong point here as there isn&acute;t a speck of dirt in the rooms and everything is done promptly and professionally. The hotel claims to be environmentally conscious with the usual cards about towel and linen reuse but that really doesn&acute;t ring true. There are only paper or Styrofoam cups wrapped in plastic bags for coffee and bathroom use. And the lobby, for some unknown reason, is excessively air conditioned to meat locker temperatures. Most hotels in Waikiki, including luxury properties, have open air lobbies. The Ramada, owing to the building&acute;s ancestry as Holiday Inn, chooses to refrigerate the lobby, especially by the elevators. By keeping the front doors open and replacing the window near the elevator with louvers the delightful island breezes would waft through and countless kilowatt hours would be saved. All in all, however, this is a good hotel where I&acute;ll probably be staying again.",4,2,102,Ramada Plaza Waikiki,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87018-Reviews-Ramada_Plaza_Waikiki-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,Honolulu,0

Refrigerator, microwave and especially the in-room safe are really appreciated. Most staff are nice and helpful and the location, while not in the very center of Waikiki, is adequate. The bus stops right in front going towards Ala Moana although bus service seems to be going downhill nowadays - obviously not the hotel&acute;s fault. Parking is easy as there&acute;s an open lot and you just display a sticker on your dashboard and park your own car whenever you care too. The lobby is still way too cold, especially near the elevators, but I guess the hotel gets free electricity or something.

I can&acute;t really comment on value for money as it was a rewards night stay with the loyalty scheme, however, out of interest I had looked at prices on the website and did look expensive for what it was but that&acute;s supply and demand I suppose.  I don&acute;t really understand the issues regarding staff friendliness to be honest. The members of staff who we spoke to/had dealings with where very friendly and efficient from check-in to concierge, bar staff and the turn down lady. You could see there were maybe one or two periphery members of staff (by that I mean staff who you can tell aren&acute;t in customer interaction roles) who didn&acute;t really look the friendliest but hey ho - that&acute;s not their bag.  Room size was very good, rooms simple but tastefully decorated. We received an upgrade to a higher floor and access to the club lounge which I wasn&acute;t expecting due to the stay being rewards nights.  Location is absolutely spot on and the middle of everything! Concierges (and Keith the Bar Tender actually) were very good at recommending the best way to get to certain places and suggesting the odd bar/districts to visit for the evenings.  On the whole a very good hotel which I would definitely stay at again (unless I fancied a change of course), though I would base this on getting what I consider an acceptable rate for the star-rating of the hotel i.e. not the $400 rate I saw when I looked.  To balance the review out, the negatives I encountered would be: 1) That the temperature control in the rooms was a bit woolly and we seemed to wake up at about 03:15 (the witching hour!) every morning absolutely boiling hot even though temperature control would be turned down. 2) While we received free wi-fi in the hotel room as part of the loyalty scheme (which was much appreciated of course) I needed to print off a single page e-mail with a reference code for the City-Pass we ordered that morning (the place where you pick it up won&acute;t just accept the code on the back of a fag packet, they want the actual e-mail).

My room was beautiful and looked right on to Times Square and I could see the Empire State building as well which was incredible.( Unfortunately I was right next door to the cleaners rooms who were very noisy early in the morning but once they had finished calling out to each other and cleaning all the rooms it was very quiet.) I did request to move but they forgot about it so I just stayed put as it was a very comfortable room other than the early morning noise and I felt very safe in this room, travelling on my own to this incredible city all the way from Australia, was very important to me, they also forgot about my birthday, which was very upsetting, as I had thought someone would have just wished me a Happy Birthday, but unfortunately there were no little niceities like that or friendliness at the Hotel, there was only one staff member who actually said hello to me during my eight day stay. There were a few other little incidents which were very upsetting but on the whole I would still be happy to recommend this hotel to any one thinking of staying there though as you cannot beat the location, straight out the door and Times Square is right there. It is safe and clean and comfortable and a very nice Hotel. Coming from Australia I had never experienced such cold weather, 2 degrees is unheard of in Australia, and after a day out and about I was so happy to get back to the warmth in the Crowne Plaza and back to my beautiful room and just sit and watch the lights on the Empire State Building. I was also lucky enough to be on the Conceirge level which had a lovely lounge area with beautiful views also, it just would have been so nice if the staff had been a little friendlier and kinder to someone who was on their own or to anyone really, it dosnt hurt to ask how was you day or how are you today, or Welcome to the Hotel and of coarse a Happy Birthday would have been so lovely and meant so much, still it was not done on purpose I know how busy they are and they do have excellent Management at the Hotel, if it could just be passed on to the staff who are actually at the Hotel, then it would be a first class Hotel. I do hope to return again with my family. I also wanted to recommend the Addams Family on Broadway it is the most wonderful show with Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth and if you are wondering what show to see this is definately the one and you can purchase your tickets from the Theatre itself, something I didnt realise at the time. After I left New York I went to Hawaii for 14 nights and experienced the best hospitality and when I arrived there was a most beautiful belated birthday/welcome basket left in my room from the Hotel Manager and I was so grateful that my birthday was acknowledged even though it was a few days later, it still meant the world to me.

Hope when the hotel is refurbished that they manage to block the noise out as it is terrible getting any sleep on the front of the hotel. Was nice to see the benches outside the hotel had been removed to distract tramps/beggars there. It was my nephews first time in Benidorm and they enjoyed it despite one of my nephews having had his wallet lifted. We had a gold card for the bar which entitles you to branded drinks we did notice however unless you asked for branded drinks they gave you the local brands. Nice that the tv in the bar and in the rooms have ITV 1 and BBC 1 and True Life Movies and Sky News. Pay ?‚¬10 for the remote control which is refunded when remote returned. Benidorm was so busy which was good to see, great to see the new 4 star hotel Flash over he road completed enjoyed listening to their outdoor music. Sorry we missed Eddie entertaining at the hotel. Looking forward to seeing the hotel when it as been refurbished but hoping it does not lose it`s character as we Brits enjoy the down the earth and friendliness of this hotel",4,1,100,Hotel Magic Villa de Benidorm,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187525-d264357-Reviews-Hotel_Magic_Villa_de_Benidorm-Benidorm_Costa_Blanca_Alicante_Province_Valencian_Country.html,Benidorm,2

Been going to this hotel many years staff faultless, missed Caroline who had left the reception.  Food as good as always but seemed geared up towards the Spanish towards end of our stay.  Got loads of mossie bites as usual despite taking precautions.  Loved the ITV 1, and True Movies as was poorly for a few days these channels handy in the room.  Sorry Eddie who does entertainment was up at Rock Gardens but Sam did a great job on entertainment as usual.  Enjoyed our gold card never drunk so many spirits with being unwell to help our chest infections lol.  Juan as welcoming as ever nothing is too much trouble nice to see some of the same staff still in their jobs in difficult times.Noor on the bar was wonderful as always.  No idea when we are returning due to ill health but it as to be the Villa for us however cheaper the other hotels are. And the first time we had a room facing the pool which is much quieter than the front of the hotel so with being unwell enjoyed the peace.

Kahlid and Karim in the restaurant are great and been here a long time they always greet you with a lovely welcoming smile food is good but as gone down in variation  One of the cleaners must ask her name as a beautiful smile and is very friendly  Sam on entertainment goes that extra mile is friendly and helpful  Looking forward to the smoking ban 2nd January 2011 the bar isn`t big enough to accomodate the smoke it`s like a fog at times and not fair on the non smokers or staff on the bar.

This hotel has it all inside the complex so you don&acute;t really need to leave the hotel for anything except to check out the night life on the strip.  Check in took longer almost 25 minutes, there was a counter for IHG gold members but it was unmanned, then there were 6-7 people behind the check in desk yet serving only 4 customers for some strange reason.  The rooms are big, spacious and clean with a flat screen TV even in the bathroom. My room had 2 double beds, sitting area and a working desk which I am told was kind of standard rooms for this hotel so lots of space for the money. Al though in room tea/coffee facility was missing which is fairly expected at all hotels now days,  Being a casino hotel you bump into a huge number of people at the gaming lounge which you have to walk through if going into the main lobby. This is usually filled with smokers and drinkers so not preferable if you have young kids. Another separate entrance/exit would have been been useful to keep kids unexposed to passive smoking.

The checkout has its own line you so there isn&acute;t a long wait and you can also do the express check out in a mail drop box if your realy pressed for time. Main Venetian pool doesn&acute;t get any sun until early afternoon (at least 2pm), the second pool had some sun shortly after noon but you can use the Palazzo pool that has sun around 9 am.  ----------  After 10 years of being open, it still looks very clean and nice...the only hotel that looked nicer was the Wynn but that one was just recently built.  Our Room on the 24 floor was the basic suite and it was plenty big for 2 people with a large bathroom (tv and great complimentary bathroom products), king bed (with a second tv) and spacious sitting area with a couch and a third tv.  Automatic blinds were handy, the bed was very comfy, the bath robes came in handy and overall our room was very quiet...no real late night noise but we stayed Sun-thurs.  Although some might find it a little bothersome, I liked the fact that you had to show your room card to security to access the elevators to your room at the elevator ground floor...this kept out people that shouldn&acute;t be there.  The hotel itself is at the north most of the south strip which makes it a little less busy then say Caesars Palace which is just about a 10 minute walk south.  there is a good Asian noodle restaurant we tried on the mainfloor in the casino area and the upstair&acute;s food court is great for inexpensive breakfast or lunch...there are also a few much nicer restaurants that we didn&acute;t try but they seemed really nice. You also have a Walgreens just outside the Hotel which can come in handy.

When checking in, the host at the desk offered much information about the hotel and the shuttle bus. The rooms were proven to be upgraded from many years of use but that&acute;s to be expected from a hotel that&acute;s been there for years.  The shuttle is great as well. It leaves before the park opens and then departs every 30 minutes after until about an hour after the park closes. It does this when picking you up at the resort as well. The drivers are very nice and helpful. If you have a stroller, they will store it in the rear (all they ask is for you to collapse it, if possible). It beats having to drive there each time.  The hotel isn&acute;t hard to find or out of the way. In fact, it&acute;s just off the freeway.

The hotel is easy to see from a few blocks away in a very dark night (okay, we also used a GPS) and the check-in process was fairly smooth given we booked from a 3rd party online.  The rooms are of average size and have good sound isolation. It&acute;s also pretty clean as expected from a 3+ star hotel.  The parking garage in the basement has a narrow entrance that requires driving on the left side. If you missed the sign and drive on the right side, it could be difficulty to back up from the ramp if someone is coming out, as the way back involves a rather steep ramp and a turn.

15327,Bon_voyage79,Hotels,1/10/2008,Wonderful Location - Adorable Hotel,"I stayed here last winter with my best friend on our first trip to London. We LOVED it!  Overall, the best thing about this hotel is the location. It is close to all the conveniences. There were several grocery stores close by and that&acute;s where I bought almost all my food. Sommerfield was my favorite and it had lots of yummy ready-made sandwiches and crisps and candies and yogurt. I enjoyed trying the different food and the prices were actually not bad. I had brought a bunch of food with me thinking that everything was going to cost an arm and a leg, but I was pleasantly surprised to find better food prices than Chicago (where I was living at the time). Bottled water is especailly cheap in London! My roommate enjoyed the fact that there was a McDonald&acute;s close by as well. There were several other fast food places but we pretty much stuck to Sommerfield and McDonald&acute;s. There is also a Barclays (bank) right there and I believe that they do not charge a service fee. Yay! And then of course, the location is prime because of the Earl&acute;s Court tube stop, just a few minutes from the hotel. It was a quick ride into the main tourist spots (10-15 mintues probably) and SO easy to use.  The hotel itself was also quite adorable. It&acute;s true that the rooms are small, but you are in Europe. We expected small and were actually surprised at how big our room was. Not big by American standards but bigger than what we were expecting. We had a bathroom, two twin beds, a TV, desk, and still some room to walk around. I can&acute;t say that the beds were especially comfortable, but they did the job. And the best part was that we had the cutest little balcony that looked out onto a large lawn and what looked like beautiful brick apartments. It was February when we were there so we didn&acute;t spend a lot of time on the balcony but it was nice knowing it was there and it also doubled as a fridge at night and we could put our goodies from Sommerfield out there to stay cold.  The only negative I can say about this hotel is that the staff was not the most friendly. They were pretty snappy with us when we checked in and we were put off trying to talk to them the rest of our vacation. But this wasn&acute;t a big deal. It&acute;s nice if they are nice, but I don&acute;t usually ask many questions of hotel staff anyway.",4,4,104,BEST WESTERN Burns Hotel Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d192138-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Burns_Hotel_Kensington-London_England.html,London,3

The reason I now stay in this part of town is because of the outstanding location that is is.  The Best Western Victoria Palace is in two separate buildings. I stayed in The Annex which was the Brindle Hotel purchased by Best Western a year ago or so. Whilst the rooms are on the smaller side (and much smaller than the main building), they are spotless and have TV, deposit box, tea/coffee and an immaculate en-suite bathroom.  Whilst I will agree with some other reviews that the towels are quite thin and the mattress a bit hard, I would like to remind these people that you do not get much in London for 60 Pounds.  Having stayed and/or seen numerous hotel in Pimlico/Victoria, the Best Western Victoria Palace offers by far the best value. Worth noting the service was excellent and a porter carried the luggage to my room.  If anything, I&acute;d just wish they had digital TV installed instead of just the five main terrestrial channels.

The only problem we run into is our package included Absolute and most bartenders were trying to serve us Smirnoff. IN the end, we stopped trying to argue about it and just told them to charge us for Absolute, when the final bill came all the drinks were taken off. The japanese habachi was good, but our favorite was the Italian. Our all inclusive package also included the food on the beach which was really nice and convinient. We had an ocean view room on the 3rd floor, which provides the nicest balcony of all the rooms. For breakfast the JW Marriott is a better option, better food and mimosas were included!

12594,Beaches2626,Hotels,1/6/2012,"Cheap, Easy, Enjoyable Vaca","We stayed at the Magna Casa for 5 nights at the end of Dec 2011 on points. The airport transfer was cheap and fairly painless we did have to wait for about 15-20 min for a couple with children to claim all their baggage before we left. The hotel was completely booked so I was surprised when we as Elite Members were upgraded from a standard to an ocean view room. We arrived at 1245 and were made to wait until 3pm for our room to be ready. So we changed into bathing suits in the bathroom and headed to the pool restaurant.  The service was all around slow but very pleasant and friendly- the slow speed could have been contributed to a fully booked hotel and the holiday season. The food was pretty disappointing with the exception of the Italian rest at the JW Marriott. The steakhouse was nothing special and the TexMex place in the JW was far from great. I actually made the poor waiter get me chips and salsa half way through the meal to make my own nachos because the flour tortillas were just so chalky and dense. The Italian place in the JW next door had amazing food !! Truly great service I wish I would have known because we would have eaten there every night of the week.  Our room was decent. The bed was the typical Marriott big comfy bed and everything was very clean. Our ocean view room, was not ocean view if we had paid for that view I would have been pissed. You had to stand on the far side of the balcony to view the ocean. From the bed or looking straight out all you could see was into other guestrooms in the JW across the way. You could clearly see exactly what was going on in the beds across the way.  Now my biggest complaint and the only real issue with this property, the shower ! OMG this thing is my arch enemy. It had this little steel knob that needed to be pulled up to make the water come out the shower head instead of the bath. So my husband and I spent a good 10 minutes pulling and twisting this thing every which way but unless you physically held it up it just kept falling back down. So maintenance came up and showed us that it needed to be pulled very softly until you left a little catch, then sometimes it stayed. Well if you turn the water hotter or colder, or look at this thing wrong it fell back down. I counted anywhere between 7-12 times during one shower I had to stop and try to pull it back up just the right way to get the water to start again. It was the most annoying thing EVER ! Another night before dinner no matter what I did I couldn??™t get it to catch and I had to have maintenance come back up to my room. Needless to say I was late for dinner. The bathroom in general is outdated with pink marble and very old fixtures. MARRIOTT FIX YOUR SHOWERS !  The pool area was decent, pretty small pool for the amount of rooms but the hot tub is HUGE! The service around the pool and on the beach is good, taco stand right there is nice. I found the prices pretty cheap everywhere on the property. With a fully booked hotel I wokeup everyday at 7am to get a beach chair, if you wokeup at 9 you weren??™t getting one by the beach or pool. I found it annoying that the towel stand didn??™t open until 8 or later sometimes, so guests were actually grabbing dirty towels out of the bin from the day before, this was a common occurrence??¦ ewwwww. Throughout the day the hotel ran out of the towels and I was often told to come back in 30 minutes.  Beach is clean and the water is beautiful- highly recommend the wave runners right infront of the hotel. We also strongly recommend Xplor tour ??“ it was an entire day of soooo much fun from ziplining, to underground cave swims, raftin, and gator off-roadin. If you can just pay at the gate- the shuttle from the hotel to the bus parking lot to the actual park was long and annoying.",4,5,105,CasaMagna Marriott Cancun,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d219145-Reviews-CasaMagna_Marriott_Cancun-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,Cancun,3

Everyone - even the employees of Wingate - seem to take car of the little animal and drive by very carefully. The room was spacious and comfortable and very clean. Check-in was quick and the employee very friendly (he worked at Kempinski before). Thanks to him we got a nice quiet room, though it was across from the elevator we had no noisy problems.

The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars, is due to the breakfast. Perhaps a slight improvement is needed (choices). If I may add one more thing - we were in a suite.

Hotel is in a good location across the street from the Tube and near many restaurants and pubs in Kensington. The tube line runs right into the heart of London without changing trains so very convenient.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. When we got there, the hotel&acute;s air conditioning was not working. Which would have been fine if we could open a window in our roon but ours was locked shut. We asked to move rooms and the staff quickly found us a much bigger room with a balcony overlooking the lovely garden in back. Overall a great hotel for the $$.

There is no problem with the breakfast vouchers. You received all the vouchers at the check-in. I had a problem with the safe, I called the concierge early in the morning and a security guy came within 10 minutes to open the safe :-)  The location is perfect (direct at time square).

It simply couldnt be closer to times square whilst still allowing you to sleep. Central park is 10 mins walk, rockerfella 5 mins walk broadway all around you, etc, etc. The hotel is also VERY busy with relentless streams of people when we were there.  Our room unfortunately didnt have a view of times square but still had a view to the hudson river all the same. Our room was reasonably tight in size but very modern throughout.  One reason we selected this hotel was because it had a gym and pool. The gym is great although undergoing some improvements. The pool however is currently closed for refurbishment which was very frustrating. The other irritations were that it costs $10 per person to use EXCEPT if you join the crowne plaza club for free!  I would recommend this hotel mainly on its great location. I also highly recommend Billy Elliott and catching any sporting event you can at Madison square garden- awesome!!",4,1,101,Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93454-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Times_Square_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,3

I have stayed at this hotel several times over the last few years. As a result of my stays, all my staff that come to the Chesapeake area stay at this hotel. I have to say that this place has the best free breakfast of all the hotels that offer a complimentary breakfast. I stay at this place for the Corned Beef Hash that they offer at breakfast. They offer other meats/proteins at breakfast, but I really like the Hash and at this place it&acute;s delicious.  The front desk clerks are the best in the business. If I would have had a Trip Advisor award pin to give these people I would have on this trip. They are good! I travel every week and I find that this place has some of the best staff in the business. The rooms are comfortable but are sparse in my opinion. The room rate is lower at this place, but the staff, the breakfast and everything make this a place to come back to.

The International Fun Run was held in front of the United Nations... which was practically out our front door. The Marathon Shuttle Bus pick up the New York Public Library was conveniently close to the hotel as well.  Yes, the hotel is quite small, but we were there to see the city... not the hotel... so we were just happy that it was clean and comfortable. The staff were very accommodating with our luggage (as we had to check out early due to the race).  The hotel restaurant was a bit lacking. Beware of the $6 tea!!

My wife&acute;s luggage was stuck in Vienna and the hotel staff had it delivered to our room the day after we arrived. Service was ok, nothing spectacular.  Our biggest complaint was that the hotel was on the Guidecca Island and we had to constantly wait on the shuttle boat. Make sure to keep a schedule with you at all times and plan your trips around the shuttle boat, there is no way to get to the hotel without hiring a private boat. We were stuck in St. Mark&acute;s Square for nearly 1 1/2 hours waiting while the boat took a break, very cold in November I might add...  Overall, I would recommend the hotel based on the hotel itself it is beautiful and world class, as expected, but I would not recommend it if you want to enjoy Venice on your own time, instead of on the shuttle boat&acute;s schedule.

This is a relatively new hotel, I would guess only a few months open and they still have a few opening pains.  The hotel itself is really nice and the room they gave me was wonderful. I am a Platinum Member of the program and the staff really didn&acute;t understand a Platinum Member which was fine with me, since 99% of the staff at all Holiday Inn Express nationwide have no concept as to what a Platinum Member really is.  They gave me an upgraded room, which again, was wonderful. The shower was awesome. In the 1 night that I was there, I took 2 showers. Great shower and I like a great shower in a hotel. I used the exercise room which was fine, not off the charts, but good.  There may be good news or bad news on this. The breakfast at this brand new hotel is the same crap you get at all the other Holiday Inn Express hotels. I am not sure if that is good or bad news, but suffice to say that is the breakfast. The morning I ate at the hotel, the egg dishes had been burned as the edges of the omelett were dark brown and black.  I find it hard to comlain about a free meal, but they could certainly do something better. My bottom line, would I stay at this hotel again. YES, is my answer. The hotel provided me with what I wanted and they had an exercise room, which is important to me. The staff are, across the board, very helpful and very nice. One perhaps unfair comment is that I thought the front desk clerk should have ironed his shirt before work. I just think the front desk guy should be looking the best they can with nice crisp clothes and a healthy smile. I know the fact that his shirt looked like an unmade bed was there, but I wear a crisp white or blue shirt daily and I think others in the business world should do the same.

There is not much space in the breakfastarea, but in the whole 10 days there was not a single day we really had to wait before we could sit down. You have to eat on carton plates and the knifes and forks were plastic, but that didn&acute;t really bother me.  The complimentary wireless internet came in very handy and worked well.

30068,ElizabethDawn,Hotels,7/7/2010,Perfect Location!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Holiday Inn from June 19-23. We had a one bedroom suite on the 16th floor.  The room was quite large by New York standards. The bedroom had a king-size bed with a flat screen tv, while the living room had a pull-out couch with another flat screen tv. There was also a small fidge and a microwave in the room, as well. Bathroom was small-ish, but worked just fine for us. The room was always very clean and well appointed with creams, soaps, shampoo, etc. Always plenty of fresh towels.  We found the service was excellent at the hotel. From the front desk staff to the bell boys, everyone was always smiling and willing to help point us in the right direction. The free breakfast was nice too, as there was always eggs, sausage, toast, cereals, etc. The eating area was pretty small, so we just grabbed a tray and ate our breakfast in our room every morning... no big deal.  The location can&acute;t be beat. You&acute;re a stones throw away from Times Sqaure (about 5 min walk), Fifth Ave shopping, Central Park (10 min), and all the major bus/ subway routes. There are lots of places to eat all around the hotel, so finding a meal was never an issue. We only had to take a cab twice for our entire stay.  Let&acute;s be real: while in NYC, the only time you&acute;re really in the room is in the mornings and at night before bed. This hotel is a great base for daily adventures around the city. There aren&acute;t a lot of fancy frills, but it is more than adequate for a standard visit to NYC.

The room size was smaller than usual (in terms of room size in other cities) but it was adequate for our stay in Manhattan. It was clean and the service staff was great. The two elevators are quite slow at times. Luckily we didn&acute;t go in and out a lot so the wait wasn&acute;t all that bad. The air condionning in our room worked great, which was key because it was over 100 degrees during the day with the humidity. We slept great!  The best part was the location.

This particular time I was thinking about the Club Lounge, and how pleasant the staff is. They have improved the lounge nicely, and have a very nice evening reception. The front desk staff are also consistently very nice and have never had any problem accommodating my requests.  As of my last stay in November, the hotel is still in the dark-ages with the TV. Yes, there is a nice big, flat-screen. But there is an extremely limited choice of channels, and the TV appears to still be cable-converted analog. You can do a decent pay-movie if you don??™t mind the charge, but trying to watch network or cable (what little there is) is pretty bad. You would think they would realize that many business travelers watch TV at night and try to accommodate them.  This property has a wonderful fitness center, which is a must for business travelers. Hotel bars are also important. :-) The bar was really crowded one night, and I ended up ordering room service because I couldn??™t even get close enough to order. The second night I had no problem getting drinks and food, and both were excellent. Over the years I??™ve learned that it all hinges on the size of the current conference so I just adjust.

I??™ve reviewed this property before, and the hotel and I still have a good relationship for the most part.  I am based out of the hotel when I??™m on business to the area, but there is usually some kind of conference in the hotel when I stay. Being in this hotel during a conference is always an interesting experience. This time there was a VFW Conference. They were a lovely group. (Not nearly as interesting as the Anime group on a previous visit, though!)  I usually stay on the 15th floor in a bi-level executive suite. The rooms are comfortable for me, and housekeeping does a good job. It is nice to have continental breakfast and evening reception in the lounge and the attendants are quite pleasant. Usually I have a drink or two at the lobby bar, but this time I used the mini-bar. I had terrible luck with getting it refilled during my stay. I guess it isn??™t like housekeeping and checked daily.  I like the quietness of the bedroom upstairs, but it is usually way too warm in the summer. It??™s hard to blame the hotel for Texas heat, but I??™ve stayed in other places that can cool down the rooms so I??™m still not sure why this one has so much trouble.  Wireless internet was sufficiently fast for me, and it??™s a good thing since the TV is still so limited at this property. The channel selection is actually one of the worst I??™ve seen in my travels. Maybe it isn??™t a priority for the hotel since I imagine most of their conference attendees rarely go back to stay at the hotel. But for those of who stay often it would be nice if they would actually get good cable access.  All that said, this is a consistent hotel. Is it perfect? No. But the desk clerks are pleasant and welcoming, the bartenders are very nice, and the housekeepers always greet guests. The location is great with so many restaurants and things to do close by.

20567,CharlesDP,Hotels,2/11/2011,Great value and excellent service from club lounge staff,"This is a great value 5 star hotel. Admittedly it is starting to show its age in the rooms but they have updated where possible and everything is clean and in perfect working order.  The hotel is not too far from the attractions in Kowloon but it is a bit of a walk to the MTR, say 10 minutes. We stayed in winter so this was not a problem but in summer you might find it a bit far too walk in the heat. You can walk out of the hotel onto the avenue of stars and to the star ferry in about 15 minutes. The avenue of stars isn&acute;t that great in my opinion, too many chinese tourist groups milling around taking photos.  The club lounge for $HKD 660 a day is great value for two people. It includes breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapes as well as in room wired and wireless internet. The service in the lounge was warm and friendly and the food delicious. The attendants were always keen to serve you drinks or take your order. I didn&acute;t actually have any contact with the concierge but instead asked the lounge staff for recommendations, this worked out very well.  In addition to a wide range of items on the breakfast buffet in the lounge you can have hot dishes made to order, like omelettes or french toast. The breakfast and afternoon tea buffets don&acute;t change much from day to day but the evening cocktails vary greatly from night to night. They have great bar staff of an evening that make cocktails to order.  The rooms are looking a bit old but have every comfort you would need and are clean and well maintained. The rooms were serviced twice a day and all requests for additional items were responded to very quickly.  We enjoyed our full harbour view room which had a great view over to HK, admittedly not a view of central but still a great view. We had an executive harbour view room which is the ambassador upgrade if you book a harbour view room. The room is slightly bigger than a standard room and on the corner of the building with rooms numbered xx35. I didn&acute;t stay in a standard room but the size of this room felt just right, any smaller wouldn&acute;t be as comfortable.  We did use the airport limo pick up service and were taken straight to check in on the club floor and greeted by name upon arrival. This was a great way to start our stay at the GS.  An important point for priority club members is that they allow you to keep your upgraded room on reward nights for no charge. I combined a paid stay, on ambassador weekend certificate, with reward nights. I arranged all of this by email before arriving so there were no surprises on check-in and everything went very smoothly. The reservations office responds promptly to emails so it is worth making contact before your stay to ensure everything goes as planned.  I felt that this hotel was very welcoming and I felt relaxed here over the four days of our stay.

The Guest Relations Manager welcome letter was one of the best I have seen. Staff all courteous and helpful. Breakfast in the Club Lounge was excellent. Harbour View rooms definitely worth the extra cost. Older fittings and decor give the property an European rather than an Asian feel. Short walk to Star Ferry Terminal and Harbour City.

We had a 1 block walk to all the shopping but the quiet of being away from it. Room was beautiful and clean. I have to say, this is the one hotel that has beds that don&acute;t feel like a hotel! I slept like a rock! My only complaint is that the only ice machine was on the 14th floor. I drink a lot of ice water and that was a little inconvienence but definitely not a deal breaker.

21003,CherylABQ,Hotels,11/9/2013,Average Rooms--Paying for the location,"Pros 1. Great service and friendly staff. 2. Great location (Union Square). 3. Breakfast at restaurant was really good! (Didn&acute;t eat there any other meals but assume it would be just as good). 4. Decent amenities: flat screen TV, mini frig, Bose radio. 5. Bedding was comfortable! (But bed itself wasn&acute;t if more than one person in a double).  Cons 1. Double beds dipped in the middle so don&acute;t plan on sharing as it&acute;s very uncomfortable. My room was big enough to fit 2 queen beds. This Marriott should upgrade! 2. Bathroom was large but the shower was way too small. 3. They charge for everything: $9.95+ and up per day for Internet; $56 per day for parking as I recall...both probably typical for this area but still expensive when you are paying $500 per night for the room. 4. Drawer space is limited to the nightstand and two very small tray drawers in the TV stand (the mini bar drinks and snacks take up 60% of it).",4,1,100,JW Marriott San Francisco Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81444-Reviews-JW_Marriott_San_Francisco_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html,San Francisco,3

However things improved massively when I got to the room; rooms were large and well appointed. The bathroom was very good, with a double sized shower. It looked like there had been a recent refurbishment. I was travelling with a group of colleagues, and we had dinner reservations, however the restaurant said that they couldn&acute;t handle such a large group, so we ended up eating in the bar. I did have some initial disappointment at this, however that quickly subsided when the food was brought out. The bar food was excellent, and there was an extensive menu to choose from.  I didn&acute;t use any of the other facilities at the hotel, but overall was very pleased with the accommodation and food.

20801,CheersTC,Hotels,9/27/2011,Comfortable hotel & great base for Thomas Land,"From the very moment we arrived right up to the minute we left the hotel staff couldn??™t do enough for us. We stayed here as a family (2 adults, 2 children) for 3 nights and used the hotel as a base for Thomas Land.  Check in was very pleasant, helpful and informative. Our room was a family room on the ground floor located close to the restaurant and bar which was great for breakfast \ dinner. The room itself consisted of a very comfortable double bed and two single beds. The bathroom was well stocked with the usual toiletries and looked to have been only done up recently. The only comment I would make in relation to the room is that it was a tad bit on the tight size but this didn??™t bother us too much.  We ate each night in the hotel. Once in Hathaways Bar and twice in the Adderley restaurant. Both had adequate menus including a decent choice of kid??™s meals. We experienced no issues with the kids themselves being in the pub or restaurant which is what you really want as a family when you??™re away. Our favourite was the Adderley restaurant and the food, service was great. Breakfast was included in our stay and again no complaints. There were plenty of healthy options and also no shortage of hot food. A great way to start the day considering we would be walking around Thomas Land all day. There is a swimming pool on site and we used it twice during our stay. It is small but adequate and towels where provided. The pool closes to guests in the evening sometime around 6pm so bear that in mind if you promise to take them swimming after Thomas Land.  Overall we had a very relaxing time, the hotel was a great base for Thomas Land and the kids enjoyed their stay here so we enjoyed it.

The hotel is nesteled in a hip, neat area of London. It has great access to the DLR and the Tube. There are counteless pubs and nice cafes to sip, drink and be merry.  When, I arrived, the front desk, check-in experience was professional and seamless. The agent offered to help and even escorted me to the elevator. The room was spacious, clean and modern. For London, it was a great value. I had a view of the canal, even though I was on the 1st floor. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was roomy and had a great surger of water from the shower head. They offered a great in-room selection of tea&acute;s and coffee. There was a safe and a desk area to work. I didn&acute;t eat at the hotel, so I can&acute;t comment. I did use the gym, which had great equipement and was open 24 hours.  The only negative that I could say was that internet was a charge item. Of course, it is an industry standard to charge so I wouldn&acute;t let that deter me from staying. The Bellman and concierge went out of their ways to give me directions. US Airways lost my luggage, so I had to do some quick shopping. There are some great areas to purchase any type of clothing. Most America&acute;s would love this place.London is on the more expensive side due to our weak dollar. You will get your money&acute;s worth during this stay.  The hotel is closer to Gatwick Airport and London city airports. Heathrow is a longer journey, but very doable. I took the Underground Picadilly to the Jublie line and got off at Canary Wharf. It was about a $12.00 ride. You have to be able to climb stairs with your suitcases. You can always take the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station and the tube or a taxi, which will range from $36.00 to around $85.00. A taxi or car service will be well above $100.00 USD. Access to the rest of London is easy on the Tube or DLR near the hotel. You can be at all the sights with a brief tube journey 20 minutes at the most.

I am not sure if it&acute;s management or ownership, but clearly there has been changes.  I first look at the chips and salsa in a Mexican Food place. The chips and salsa at this place are top notch. They accommodated our request for more spicy salsa, but the regular salsa is just fine. One of the better salsa&acute;s that I have had.  I found the pork taco&acute;s to be just OK, not the best. I did like the beef chalupa. My family had ordered the fish tacos and beef enchiladas, both of which were said to be good. What I did notice is that the restrooms were spotless! They were fresh and cleaned, which is a big change from before. The restrooms were very impressive and a nice change.  I would suggest the more traditional Tex Mexican dishes with beef or chicken, rather than the pork.

I give an A- to the guacamole, I prefer a little more cilantro in my guacamole and I like tomatoes in it. As I said, It&acute;s still an A, but A- in my book.

We contacted the front desk security came and took pictures of the marks, and we both filed a report. We were upgraded to a Primier Suite, which was gorgeous!!!!  A few days after our arrival home, we were contacted by the Luxor informing us that there were in fact bed bugs in our room!!!!!

This hotel is also joined with the Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur. You don&acute;t have to go outSide to get to these either.  I stayed in a stqueen delux room which had two queen size beds. They were really comfortable. Unfortunatly there was no refrigerator in the room and it was a $10 a day charge to get one. There was also no lock box, these were available downstairs. Other than than....you do get a TV, iron and hair dryer. The view is nice as well!  If you plan on booking up here, do a google search for online coupon codes to use.

I had to chase down a waiter (not even ours) to ask for refills, I was craving a dessert and waited about 20 mins for the waiter. When she arrived, she attempted to just sneak and leave the receipt on the table. I had her take it and add the dessert I wanted. The tip I left showed my disappointment with the service.

We had such a great time - I can&acute;t understand what all the complaints are about!? It all started at check-in: Bernie was awesome and gave us a free upgrade to a fountain view room on the 23rd floor. Absolutely stunning views. We were able to watch the Bellagio fountains right from our room every night. We had a standard 2 queen bed room, which was a little on the dark side, but totally fine. No complaints, except that a fridge would have been nice. Big bathroom with separate tub & shower and lots of room for 2 girls to get ready. Maid service was great. This hotel is literally in the middle of everything. Paris hotel is next door, Bellagio & Caesar&acute;s across the street -- couldn&acute;t ask for more! Loved the location and the Miracle Mile shops attached to the casino. Lots of options for food & drinks -- make sure you try Gordon Ramsay&acute;s BurGR restaurant, it was amazing! Yolo&acute;s Drunken Nachos were also a hit! The casino has a young, cool vibe, which we really enjoyed. Loved coming back from a night out at the clubs to hear the music blasting and everyone having a great time. Really makes it feel like Vegas. It&acute;s a bit smoky, but so is every other casino on the strip, so it&acute;s something you just have to get used to. We had Britney Spears tickets and loved the show -- felt like we were teenagers again! She plays at the Axis Theatre in PH, so it was super convenient and easy to get to. All said and done, I give this property 4 stars. Great service at the front desk, everything was clean & well-kept, and the location can&acute;t be beat.

Otherwise I found the employees of the hotel to be quite friendly and helpful!

25171,DallasChris,Hotels,7/2/2015,"Nice hotel and rooms, but some aspects need severe updating","I recently stayed at this hotel for 7 nights for a conference. It is a beautiful hotel on the outside, and in the lobby and second floors. The lobby is great with fountains everywhere. My son lost his hat in a fountain and the staff quickly found and returned it to our room. We had multiple issues with our door locks, but the staff made up for it with free breakfast buffet (which was awesome) and free spg points.  The rooms were updated and very nicely appointed. We had adjoining rooms with our family and it was no inconvenience. The elevators are great that open out to the atrium and then outdoors. Beyond all of that, we found out that the hotel has been feautred in at least 9 Hollywood films! They&acute;re all displayed in the hallway on the way to the garage. Parking is prohibitively expensive though, it is valet only and $47 per night! But we had the best welcome staff who gave us a discount since we were staying so many nights.  I have a couple of gripes about the hotel though. The 2nd and 4th floors are not accessable using the regular elevators, only the service elevators. This was a major hassle for my party as we had a stroller and couldn&acute;t go up and down a flight of stairs. Also, I&acute;m sure that there are handicapped guests who don&acute;t appreciate being treated like cargo to reach these floors. Floors 3-5 are terrible! They are extremely outdated, for example the 1994 film True Lies used these elevators. The scenery from the 3-5 floors is exactly as it was in the film over 20 years ago! Some may find this nostalgic, I found it off-putting. Don&acute;t for any reason think you will eat on the 4th floor &acute;food court&acute;. It is a very run down group of sickly looking restaurants. I went there and did not want anything I saw. I am glad they used their capital expenditures on the rooms, but it may be time to update the elevators and 3-5 floors.  Overall, I really liked the hotel, if you never need to visit floors 3-5 you&acute;ll never have a bad thought about it.",4,1,100,The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32655-d77874-Reviews-The_Westin_Bonaventure_Hotel_Suites-Los_Angeles_California.html,Los Angeles,3

10099,AustinBeach001,Hotels,7/27/2013,Much better the second time!,"We stayed at the Westin adjacent to South Coast Plaza for our second time for 2 nights checking in on 07/21. We arrived late on the 21st, about 9pm and everything was ready for us, keys and all. We received the same room as the 1st, room 311, a large corner room with 2 Double Beds (not Queens...) and the room was clean and nice, a typical Westin room. The room overlooked the business park across from the valet entrance and the bridge to South Coast Plaza, nothing overtly special. One odd thing I noticed in the room was the air conditioner. At night, due to a lack of movement, the air conditioner would turn off and the room was would just start to bake. Next day, we had maintenance come by and they turned off the motion sensing function. I feel like that was taking being environmentally friendly too far and at the expense of the guest, as I felt in my last stay here. The bathroom was clean, could have been a little nicer, but decent. The next morning we got up and spent the day at Disneyland, and the pool was nice to relax by and swim in after a long day of walking. Parking at the hotel was reasonable, with Valet at $30 and Self-Parking at $21. We valeted our car and they were very swift retrieving our car whenever we requested it to be pulled around. Overall, this is your typical business hotel in Orange County, and I would stay here again. We got the hotel as a steal in Priceline for $80, but I would consider paying the rack rate, around $200.  I would like to give a shout out to Irma, the front desk agent. She was wonderful!",4,0,100,The Westin South Coast Plaza,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32253-d76671-Reviews-The_Westin_South_Coast_Plaza-Costa_Mesa_California.html,Costa Mesa,3
10132,AustinBeach001,Hotels,7/27/2010,"A great deal, wouldn&acute;t have paid full price","For our $79 deal of Hotwire.com, this was a great steal, as were flying into Long Beach at 7pm and leaving for Dana Point early the next morning. The rooms were nice and the service was good but not worth the rack rate of $209. We arrived on 7/25 and stayed for 1 night. We were pleased to see that they upgraded us to a Corner room (Rm. 311) for free. About have of the 3rd floor is empty Conference rooms so the floor was pretty quiet. The hotel is older, as you can see signs in the shower, hallways. etc. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well (except for 1 pillow after I learned after the fact). The rooms are modern and look appealing to the eye. Westin Hotels have gone to far with going green. I understand about being eco-friendly and all but cutting down the quality of services has to go. The showerheads get turned off, replacing trash bins so you can only recycle only recyclable products has to go, not good for the advertised 4-stat hotel. Westin... you need to take this away. You will begin to lose service this way. The location was great. Right off the 405 and connected to South Coast Plaza. We did not use the pool or fitness center but they looked appealing. Also, we did not eat at their restaurant, Pinot Provence as we were only there for about 10 hours.

The building and entrance looks far more grand and more what you&acute;d expect to see at a top tourist destination, and it flows much better than it use to.  There was a lot of staff on hand to answer questions and we loved the Clownfish Cove play area for kids (including bathrooms for pint sized visitors!) We noticed the Dolphin show is not as showy as it use to be, and I&acute;m assuming that&acute;s due to so many complains about the treatment of the animals. Everything they did during the Dolphin show were things Dolphins do normally and it was very educational.  We had a great time and my boys loved it.

The price for all day admission is $21 per adult and $13 for a child (3 and under are free.)  There is so much to see that you at least need half a day to see everything. The outside tanks hold Beluga Whales (there is a show), Dolphins (also has a show) Ottors and Sea Lions.  Inside their are numerous tanks that hold tropical fishes, octopuses, sea horses, sharks, etc. You can also see bats, bugs, frogs and sloths!  One of the highlights for us is visiting the 4-D show which is much like something youd see in Disneyland. Inside the movie theatre you watch a movie and literally experience the sights, sounds, smells and feel of whatever you are watching. Very enjoyable!  There is a restaurant on site that serves hamburgers, hotdogs, sandwhiches etc, but it is on the pricey side. We usually will bring our own packed lunch. There is also a large gift shop with every kind of souvanier you can imagine.  If you are visiting Vancouver as a tourist I highly suggest you plan to attend the Aquarium.

Unfortunately I am a 43 year old guy that did not appreciate the over the top aesthetic of the guest rooms. The design is based on dark wood and pink neon with red wall paper. Sounds better in writing than it is in person.  The creative director of the hotel&acute;s design firm was allowed to go way way way beyond what other W&acute;s that I have had the privilege to stay at worldwide ( San Francisco and Hong Kong for example) where the design was fun and not distracting. The other properties don&acute;t take themselves too seriously , in a design sense, and I liked spending time in the airy and bright spaces. This W&acute;s guest room design doctrine is just dark.  The public spaces are better. The staff are some of the best that I have ever interacted with in any hotel, worldwide, of any brand.The bed was great. The shower was wonderful.

The room/suite was absolutely gorgeous and I felt like I just wanted to stay in the room to enjoy the ambience of it.  What I did not like was the fact that absolutely everything (ok, apart from nice Bliss toiletries) seemed to be chargeable and things were not cheap. There is a small gym (not state of the art, as the hotel advertises it), but no swimming pool.

12998,Belgian_EU,Hotels,5/22/2012,Fantastic staff at the W,"So having read some of the reviews, I wanted to give my opinion of this new hotel in the centre of London. First, it is a W. I wouldn&acute;t stay here for business. Second, it&acute;s in London. So you don&acute;t get a swimming pool and you don&acute;t get enormous rooms. Third, it&acute;s at Leicester Square. This is tourist central. So you don&acute;t get quiet and you do get hordes of tourists wandering around outside.  Lastly, it&acute;s a hip destination. So there&acute;s a nightclub on the 1st floor that&acute;s pounding until 4am. There&acute;s disco music piped at you and everything&acute;s dark and moody and cool. So if you want a Sheraton, or a Westin, don&acute;t stay here.  If you want a cool hotel for the weekend, close to Soho&acute;s attractions, with friendly and helpful staff who always had a smile for me - then give it a try. You will be mixing with the cool trendy set of London and the international jet-set.  The standard room is small, but I&acute;ve had smaller. Excellent shower and toiletries. Ask for a room at the back of the hotel if you are disturbed by the noise from the club.  Just two annoying things. First is the wifi charges. Hotels all over the world charge far too much for the internet which, these days, is essential. Second, the light switches. Confusing and takes far too long to get everything to switch off at night.  So know your hotel and know why you&acute;re going. And if you want a fun time, try the W.",4,3,103,W London Leicester Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1718977-Reviews-W_London_Leicester_Square-London_England.html,London,3
13005,Belgian_EU,Hotels,7/10/2011,Very sleek and stylish hotel,"We stayed two nights over the weekend at the W in July 2011 and I was very impressed. Firstly simply due to the number of staff, which is unusual in a hotel in Europe. From enough people at reception (on the 1st floor, not the ground) to the waiters fussing over you at breakfast, it meant that things got done.  Be prepared for the hotel to be extremely cool. The staff are well-dressed but almost to a fault helpful, welcoming and available. Josh in particular welcomed us to the hotel with charm and style, while we were being checked in. Not the cheapest place in the world, but you get what you pay for.  Be warned that the club in the hotel can get loud. We had a room on the 2nd floor but on the opposite corner, and whereas you could hear (and feel) the music as you got out of the lift, the room itself was extremely quiet. And the bed very comfortable.  One downside was that the Wifi was not free in the rooms. The hotel has done the usual bad deal with Quadriga (horrible people) and it&acute;s GBP16 for 24 hours.  Breakfast in the Spice Market was excellent with good coffee, fresh orange juice and very attentive staff.",4,1,101,W London Leicester Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1718977-Reviews-W_London_Leicester_Square-London_England.html,London,3

13063,Benjamin_S,Hotels,1/4/2013,Comfortable Stay outside the Centre of Paris,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of a Leger New Year Coach Tour to Paris.  Location The Hotel is about a 20 minute coach ride to the Eiffel Tower without any substantial traffic. There are limited shops, restaurants in the immediate area.  Hotel The hotel looked smart from the outside and was clean and spacious on the inside.  Room The room (112) was a decent size and looked onto the internal courtyard. The bed was excellent, extremely comfortable. The usual toiletries and tea and coffee were included. There was adequate storage for the length of our stay. There is a mini bar but you have to get the key from reception, same with the safe.  Food & Drink We were on a bed and breakfast rate. It was quite busy at breakfast as there were other coach tour parties staying at the Hotel which meant things did run out although the staff did seem to do their best to replenish. The croissants and baguettes were really tasty and on the whole breakfast was pretty good. There&acute;s tea, coffee and juices available, cereals, fruit, yoghurts, ham and cheeses as well as bacon, scrambled egg and small sausages.  Staff Didn&acute;t have much interaction with the staff apart from at breakfast where they seemed pleasant enough.  Overall If you have booked a coach trip to Paris and are staying at this Hotel, it is perfectly adequate and comfortable. The fact that it is not in the centre of Paris doesn&acute;t matter as the coach drops you off and picks you up.  If you are taking a trip to Paris and want a Hotel near the sites then I would not recommend this one as I wouldn&acute;t want to have to make the journey without the comfort of an included coach.

The hotel is located approx 15 Km to the west of Paris. As other reviewer has mentioned, there is a bus stop right outside of the hotel - bus no 258 that takes you to the terminal station of line 1 - La Defense. The bus route cost Euro 1.80 and it takes about 30 mins. Bus interval is between 20 to 30 mins depends time of day.  From La defense, line 1 will take you to major attraction like the Louvre Museum and it costs Euro 1.70. Someone told me that it is better to buy a 1 day pass but i didnt find that option on the automatic ticketing machine but you can try the ticketing booth.  Tips on the ticketing machine - the option for language is buried in the second page after you selected an option from the first page. Try your luck and you be fine. You only need a ticket to get in and then exit from station doesnt require a ticket. On the metro, the door doesnt open automatically and you either have to press a green button or rotate a lever. Dont pull on the door handle otherwise the door wont open - I learned that by hard experience!  Back to the hotel, it is ok. And there is plenty of couches in the lobby area to use free wifi. Hotel facilities are on par with the price paid as we saw it costed around US$100 per night per room during the winter season - maybe a little more during the summer season,.

26727,DennisvdMolen,Hotels,10/25/2014,easy in easy out,"Sheraton Schiphol blijft erg prettig gezien hun locatie. Vroeg vliegen maakt dit hotel excellent om te verblijven. Vanuit het hotel loop je zo de terminal in, en bent binnen 10 min bij de gate.  Alleen...... de kamers blijven warm, dit probleem kent het sheraton nu al meer dan 5 jaar, en helaas wordt hier niks aan gedaan. De recente renovatie heeft in mijn ogen niet veel positiefs toegvoegd aan het hotel. Ben er in de tussentijd 3 x geweest, en in elke kamer was er wel wat, lekke badkamer, slecht sluiten kast deur ( lichtje in de nacht) Daarnaast is de mini-bar verdwenen sinds de renovatie en ik blijf dit erg jammer vinden, zeker voor een hotel die pretendeert een 5-sterren hotel te zijn en makkelijk rond de 260 euro per nacht rekent.  Als frequent verblijver, sinds 6-8 jaar, zie ik de klantvriendelijk achteruit hollen, het nieuw gebouwde Hilton naast het Sheraton, zal een stevige concurrent worden.

26737,DennisvdMolen,Hotels,4/18/2014,Duur in verhouding tot wat je krijgt,"Het Sheraton Schiphol, een regelmatige plek waar ik verblijf. Met prijzen van vaak boven de 230 E, vaart dit hotel wel bij zn locatie. Direct uit het hotel zo in de aankomst is erg prettig wanneer je een vroege vlucht hebt. Echter de kosten voor een kamer zijn buiten proprotioneel voor wat je ervoor terug krijgt. NA een completen &acute;overhaul&acute; van de kamers, is de mini-bar verwijdert van de kamer. Je kan nu met je kamersleutel naar de ligt lobby, op je verdieping en daar in een machine je keuze maken. Wanneer je zoals ik laat nog wel eens trekt hebt, kun je of met je badjas en je sloffen of je weer helemaal aankleden, en je vervolgens vervoegen in de openbare ruimte. Voor een 230+ per nacht mag je verwachten dat dit goed geregeld is. Dan de quick-checkout, hoe erg handig is dit, kaartje invullen en in de bus gooien. Helaas werkt het doorsturen van de rekening soms maar matig, en loop je soms het geld ( expenses) mis als je dit niet in de gaten houdt.. Je moet er dan weer achter aan om je digitale rekening via email te krijgen.  Ook dit vind ik voor 230+ per nacht niet aangenaam. kortom, vanwege de locatie een geweldig hotel, die soms de kop een btj laat hangen, vanwege het succes en de goede ligging.

3818,ALP86,Restaurants,5/22/2012,Nice Sunday Lunch,"Went sunday lunch on 20th May with two others and enjoyed the two course (??15) option.  The setting is very nice and is located in former bank vault. Althrough warm as a result the setting is still pleasent.  For starter I had the fish and mussy peas which I found to be rather dull and very dry. However the Lamb starter had by another of my group was fantastic.  For mains we all had the beef which was well cooked (rare) and servied with ample veg (however, it could do with more options rather than a lot of a few).  Drinks are reasonblely priced and the bar is very well stocked.  Saddly there were only two desert options and neither seemed appealing.  In conclusion what I has was mostly very good, but more variation is needed.

11133,BMWilliams1982,Restaurants,10/28/2011,"Great Value, great food and great location","The Potted Pig is a welcome new treat to Cardiff, mainly in my opinion because of its location. So many of the better restaurants in Cardiff are found in the suburbs (probably because of extortionate rates that only the major chains can afford) so to have this place open up in town is great.  The setting is interesting, deep down in the caverns of a former bank vault. You are greeted by a very friendly chap on the door at street level who takes you down, takes your coats and leaves you with an equally friendly waitress/waiter. This may seem trivial but its these little touches that make a good restaurant great.  They have done well with the menu, not only with the local ingredients on offer and the variety of food but also the size of the menu. Small enough to choose, big enough to have choice! That said the gin menu was astonishing - I have never seen so many on offer! I think they must have a thing for gin here.  The food was very well cooked, wholesome and unpretentious but still beyond most ordinary chefs. The only slight let down was the porter house steak which one of our party had - very expensive and could have been more outstanding for the money. All our other meals though were lovely with particular praise heaped on the Cassoulet and the starter of Cod Cheeks and Cockles on Toast - very good.  The atmosphere was great, it works for groups and couples alike. I would like to go with a group of 8 as that qualifies you to have the whole suckling pig! The staff were really friendly and attentive and the bill was very reasonable. We all had 3 courses, loads of wine and other drinks and still kept it under ??40 per head.  As a visitor to Cardiff this is a great choice as a one off, as a resident its going to be one to rely on for years to come.

However some research led me to this establishment one tube stop on. As it turned out this was the first really hot day of summer and at Amerigo Vespucci we were able to eat outdoors. The Menu was not huge but perfectly adequate. As we decided to eat outdoors I suspect that we did not get to appreciate the ambience of the restuarant which looked very nice inside. Our only disappointment was that a tablecloth was not laid on our outside table. Others dining outdoors did but we were quite late sitting down and maybe that is why.

I always come with my own list and they graciously make the reservations for me when I email them and confirm them when i arrive. This year when we left for the airport it was raining and fashion week so they had to really work to get us a taxi . However, they came through for us.

But not only did I fall in love with Paris this hotel was the perfect location for everything I wanted to do. It was in the heart of St. Germain, steps from a taxi stand and metro station. I walked EVERYWHERE! I was amazed by the amount of cafe&acute;s and shops so close to the hotel. The hotel was very nice and clean. Breakfast was limited in selection but very good and fresh. The front desk staff was super nice (especially the Portugese woman who works during the day. Our biggest compalint about the room is the heating and air. Our A/C was not turned on, I suppose because it&acute;s not usually 70 degrees in March. But... since our room was so hot we had to sleep with the window open and someone on the ground starts banging on trash cans at 5am.

12652,Bear_Eskimo,Hotels,12/31/2010,A great choice for our honeymoon!,"We stayed at the Berjaya for 11 nights - 6 in a renovated rainforest studio and 5 in a premier chalet on water - and were really pleased with both. Having read the reviews here, we ensured we booked one of the renovated rainforest rooms and it was lovely. As we had a relatively long stay, it was a great idea to change rooms as the atmosphere of each was very different.  The wildlife in the rainforest was a real highlight (took a torch and did our own animal spotting on the way home each night, having done Dev&acute;s walk!) but being in a room literally over the water was a treat too (slightly older rooms but still very nice). The standards of cleanliness in both were second to none and the staff at the resort are all super friendly which creates a welcoming feel.  We were very pleased with the meals we had - the only restaurant we didn&acute;t try was the Japanese. For a longer stay, it was nice to have a variety of options each evening. The room service was also very good. Nice to be able to get wine, by the glass or bottle, with our meals too - that can be a rarity in Asia!  As the Oriental Village shopping area is so close (the resort shuttle will take you there and back), it was great to be able to pick up our own beers/spirits and snacks to reduce cost.  The shuttle service is excellent but we actually loved being able to walk around. It balanced the lazing around and indulgence!!  All in all, we were really happy with our stay. A word of warning though...just as we left after Christmas, there was a marked difference in vibe and service levels (the staff seemed to struggle with the volume of people) - being a large resort that is popular with families, peak season makes a big difference. So if you&acute;re planning a romantic, quiet getaway, avoid peak season!",4,1,101,Berjaya Langkawi Resort - Malaysia,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298283-d307706-Reviews-Berjaya_Langkawi_Resort_Malaysia-Langkawi_Langkawi_District_Kedah.html,Langkawi,6
22530,ClemFR,Hotels,2/7/2009,Pleasant stay at the Berjaya in Jan 2009,"My partner and I stayed at the Berjaya for 10 nights in a chalet on water, and came back a few days ago. My partner found it difficult to sleep at times, when the tide was coming up as the water crashes on the rocks. However, that was easily resolved with some sleep on the beach during the day!  The day we left home, I read the latest reviews on Tripadvisor and they were awful, so I was upset. Now I can say that the bad reviews on Tripadvisor all seem to refer to people who booked jungle chalets. We went to one of them randomly and it was less nice than our water chalet indeed ??“ so I understand some of the reviews. The advice here is: save up more (or stay fewer nights overall) and book a new chalet = the water ones (or very close to the seafront). They are more expensive but at least you get peace of mind. The water chalets come with little extras such as separate shower from the bath, bathrobes, a safe, complementary bottled water, balcony facing the sea, bright room (trees in the jungle make the jungle chalets very dark inside), less bugs (just some ants at night but you can plug in a device that put them off), ??¦ You can see a resort map on Berjaya Resorts website, very useful - check prices on their site directly too, they have some offers at times. Some reviewers state that they didn??™t like the monkeys/animals around??¦ Well, if you don??™t want them around in their natural habitat, you should not choose a resort right at the edge of a 5 million year old jungle in the first place!  We stayed during the period of Chinese New Year ??“ we live in China and the country shuts down for a week, so we went abroad for a break. The resort was a bit busy that week, but the 1 day before and the 2 days after were quiet. Because the resort is comprised of 500 chalets/rooms, with 2 to 3 people per room, avoid peak periods. The guests are split between two restaurants for breakfast to spread the crowd. If you stay at a Jungle chalet, chances are you will be asked to go to the lobby restaurant (Dayang) -and have to pay for it. If you stay at a chalet on Water, you will be directed to the Beach restaurant -and it is included. The choice changes a little bit every day and overall, you can get a decent breakfast including fresh juice (ask for it), tea/coffee, freshly cut fruits, various types of bread, waffles, eggs cooked to your liking, Asian hot dishes (such as chicken curry and nasi lemak), cheeses, salads, cereal, etc. No idea how much it costs as it was included for people staying in water chalets.  We pre-organised Berjaya to pick us up at the airport, it costs 15 Ringgits (MR) per person. By taxi, it is 24MR in total. Note that in Malaysia, most taxi rides have pre-defined costs and for example, at airports, they have taxi counters where you pay the fixed fee before getting into a cab. No driver will drive you around and waste time. Good stuff. Check-in was smooth. We were welcomed by Joyce. We had a welcome drink while she was doing a bit of admin, then we all hopped on a shuttle to our water chalet. She showed us around in the room, very clearly. Her dynamism and kindness were pleasant to us, as a first impression. We liked the view, but the chalet (to my surprise) was not decorated in any exotic way. Nevermind, it was bright, clean and quiet. Our bed was 2 beds together, no big deal, but the mattresses were not too comfortable to us and the edges too hard. Nothing major though, could sleep OK!  There are 2 bars and 4 restaurants: lobby bar, pool bar, then the main restaurant under the lobby called Dayang serving Chinese and Malay food (did not try it), a separate Chinese restaurant (did not try it). Then the 2 restaurants we used are the ones I will talk about. They were the Beach one (serving Western, Malay and Indian food ??“ menus differ from lunch to dinner) and the Thai one (at the end of a pier, for dinner only). Those 2 restaurants were serving good food and the staff was very attentive, polite, smiley. At the Beach restaurant, burger and chips costs 19MR, prawn-avocado salad 20RM, lamb-mango salad 22MR, pizza 20MR (6 inches)/ 32MR (9 inches), pasta MR35-40. Evening main dishes include chicken curries with poppadoms, small dhall and pilau rice for around 50MR (add 10 MR for garlic naan), and Australian tenderloin for around 60MR ??“ this dish is served with a very small amount of vegetables; maybe have a side of chips on top. The Thai restaurant is at the end of a pier and the food is very tasty. Dinner with 2 starters, 2 mains + rice to share and a bottle of wine will cost you around 250MR.  On the contrary of what I read on a recent review, they do serve you on the beach. Two members of staff arrive at 12 and stay until 5 at their little beach stand, where you can order food and drinks that are then served at your sun bed. Also, right at the entrance of the beach, the Fruit Stall is open from 12 to 6, and they prepare fresh fruits to order, priced by weight. For example, 100g of watermelon is 2.5MR (50 British pence). The prices at the Berjaya are inclusive of service tax (10% across the country) and because of Langkawi status, no Government tax (normally at 5%) applies. I would say that food & drinks at Berjaya overall are not cheap, it is quite close to UK prices. 250MR is 50GBP. But we went to check 2 other restaurants in other resorts (at Mutiara and at Casa del Mar) and the prices were higher. We didn??™t eat at the Mutiara (next door resort), but tried Casa del Mar on Cenang (=Chenang) beach. The setting is lovely, right on the soft sand and under palm trees. Do go there for a treat. Call in the morning to book or the best tables will be gone. The prawn starter (6 massive prawns on skewers) was amazing, at 29MR + 10% service charge. The main courses are a bit on the nouvelle cuisine side, so maybe a side dish also. Finally, about the 2 restaurants at Berjaya, both have live entertainment, just a guitar and a singer, pleasant, not annoying at all like some reviews said. The live band in the lobby who plays from 9.30pm until 1am is louder and play some famous tunes, so if you are in a bit of a party mood, that??™s quite fun.  About Mutiara: I have to say that the resort looked tired, depressing and they have no beach. The guests overlooking the Berjaya next door must have felt jealous at the nice resort with a private beach. About Cenang (=Chenang ??“ no need to repeat, save space) ??“ we only went there once for dinner at Casa del Mar, and we were so glad we didn??™t book a hotel on Cenang! It is crowded, noisy and mostly, not neat. If you are a 25 year old baba-cool guy, that??™s your kind of place. But the exact location of Casa del Mar is away from the cool area, so it was OK. They only have 34 rooms and I would say no privacy, as they are all in a massive 2 storey house; we much prefer the individual chalets with no shared wall with other guests. Matter of taste.  At Berjaya, you are given beach towels for the day. Go to the little hut by the pool to pick them up. The pool area was pretty but so busy. If you want to relax and doze off, don??™t go there. The music can be a bit loud as well. We noticed that most families, and Chinese groups, stayed around the pool area, which made it crowded and noisy, so we avoided it. On the beach, people really want to relax so there is no loud talking, shouting, etc. Most couples are there, quiet and definitely wanting calm. Families are not encouraged to go there unless you (and your kids) are quiet, or you??™ll have 90% of the people around you staring and despising you for disturbing??¦ Mobile phones are not welcome there, same reaction as above. The beach is private, only Berjaya??™s guests can access it. The water is warm and clean but it is not transparent, rather murky as the sand floats a bit, so there is no snorkelling possible here. No corals anyway. This disappointed me at first, but I forgot about it rather quickly and relaxed. We thought about the Pulau Payar trip but all reviews and experiences made us realise it could be an unpleasant experience, like crowds of hundreds of us cramped on a boat, obeying to x and y comments from organisers like a herd of sheep and not having our own experience of relaxing snorkelling. We went to Koh Tao (Thailand) last year and we did the around-the-island day trip and we were a boat of 5 people, each creek was quiet and we were free. That was worth it. We were quite put off by the Payar details so didn??™t go for it.  About the staff and service: they were great! What needed to be done, it seems, was a good kick in the management??™s butt. And it has happened. During our stay, we met several times with the new Manager of the resort; he is Australian and started his role just 1 week before we arrived. New measures were already in place and during our stay we observed some changes: the beach huts were being renovated, brand new towels were distributed in the rooms and the staff was being monitored. I have to say again that the staff (restaurant, bars, housekeeping, etc) at Berjaya was very friendly. They greet you at any time of the day with a big smile. We could observe that some guests never smiled or didn??™t talk to them nicely. If those kinds of people reviewed on Tripadvisor and said they didn??™t like the service much, then it??™s half their fault. If you show courtesy, are pleasant and respectful, you will be served better and overall have a better time, right?  The spa at the Berjaya is nice, in the jungle but close to the seashore. We had the aromatherapy one for 60 mins, very nice. By booking on site, it costs around 160MR. We had pre-booked our massages when we booked our chalet on Berjaya??™s website so it was less (128MR per person).  Berjaya can offer various activities at a cost (waterskiing is 130MR for 30 mins for example). We didn??™t think it was worth it but it??™s a personal opinion.  We did the cable car to go up the 2nd highest peak of Langkawi, just by the Berjaya??™s entrance ??“ nice views. What you see mostly is the gigantic Geopark Jungle Forest and a tall (but hardly any water) waterfall on your way up. The oriental village seemed OK but we didn??™t wander much. They have a duty free shop so if you want to get beer for 4MR or wine for 40MR, go there. Cigarettes are 50-70MR for a box of 10 packs. Sun cream is also cheaper there.  One clear highlight of our holidays was discovering about the fauna and flora of Langkawi, thanks to Dev??™s Adventure Tours. I will put my review on this site under what to do in Langkawi.  Thanks to the Berjaya??™s location, we could carry on watching the wildlife every day, such as herons fishing right by our chalet, monkeys running around (one black one with crazy eyes charged me one afternoon as I walked back to the chalet. I think he thought I had a fruit in my hand, but didn??™t so he diverted his run at the last second. It was quite scary I have to say). I also saw a rare encounter; Dev the conservationist took a few seconds to believe me. It happened by the Beach restaurant at breakfast time. There was a very loud noise, a cry, not a pleasant one. Most people stopped eating and ventured off to find the source. Then I saw it: a monitor lizard (a very big one!) had caught a flying lemur and had one of his limbs in his mouth. The Lemur was in crucial pain and his cry was unique, sad and very loud??¦ I didn??™t have my camera with me, what a shame! The staff went towards them to separate them. It??™s not a good thing when humans interfere with nature, but really it was painful to watch and hear so I am glad they did it.  Berjaya means Success in Malay. I hope this resort will keep improving ??“ they are definitely doing something about it with a new manager in place.  I recommend the Berjaya for a nice stay in Langkawi, with a preference for a chalet on or very near the water. They are in good conditions and you get more peace. It is not a high luxury resort (like on Datai bay) but it a good quality one, it is very nice, spacious and friendly.

No maid service for stays of 1 week or less but this was fine and rather nice not to have anyone come in our room at all.  Issues: the frige-freezer, which was lovely and big, made quite a lot of noise whenever the motor was on; the heat/cool unit is an airconditioner fitted to the wall under the window - it did warm the room up but it was quite a large unit that rather noisily blew air around the room and we had to turn the TV up when the unit was on.

30033,ElizabethChester,Hotels,10/12/2012,A very enjoyable stay,"This is a large and well run hotel with a very good leisure centre. Our bedroom was large with a double and single bed. One lady, who had booked a single room, had a double bed and two single beds. Our room was well furnished, had a window that opened and a distant view of the Menai Straits. Ensure that your key cards are issued at the same time. We were told to return to Reception later for a second card, but then the original card did not work. A second pillow was supplied on request. The mattress was exceedingly firm and the duvet much too hot.  Our group ate in the ballroom, where there was an 8.30 am start for breakfast. One couple, who arrived at 8.15 am, was asked to leave as breakfast was not ready. There was a good choice at the breakfast buffet and hot covered items on the Saturday morning. However, on Sunday morning, the covers had been removed and items were only luke-warm. The bacon was especially good. Staff served tea and coffee from large pots and the tea tasted stewed if you had the dregs. Hot water was brought on request in little pots. At dinner three courses were ordered at the start of the meal. All the waiting on staff worked together as a team, serving each table. Some guests had to ask for certain vegetables, e.g. peas, cauliflour as these were often missing from the serving dishes by the time the last guests were being served. There was a plentiful supply of iced water on the tables.  There are seating areas on each landing well away from the bedrooms and a Pepsi machine on the third floor landing. There is only one lift, so there is often a queue.  The leisure centre has a shaped swimming pool, shallow near the edges and so especially good for children or poor swimmers. Children can use the pool until 6 pm on week days and 5 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. An instructor was shouting instuctions on Friday evening to what sounded like a class of 20 children, but which turned out to be only 2! The jacuzzi uses water from the swimming pool, but the sauna is hot.

We had a room with one queen bed, and while it was not spacious, there was enough room for us to store our things and move around without problems. Bed was comfortable, linens of decent quality. The bathroom was a good size (though a shelf in the shower would have been nice!) The room, bathroom, hallways, elevator and lobby were clean, and the staff were very good - we were able to check in 4 hours early, and housekeeping was great about fulfilling small requests (extra towels, giving us conditioner as well as the provided shampoo.) Breakfast had a limited selection but was adequate - basic fruit, hard boiled eggs, make-it-yourself waffles, bread, bagels and muffins, juice, coffee and tea. I&acute;ve definitely had worse in better hotels. Free wifi.  Well located for subway access to midtown or DUMBO in Brooklyn, and an easy walk to the Lower East Side, Chinatown, Nolita and Soho. The streets are very busy in the day, and fairly quiet at night, but well-lit enough to make me feel safe even without a lot of people around.  Best part about the room were the windows - a long and a short wall with floor to ceiling windows, facing south and east (no balcony access, but it was January!) During the day it was sunny and let us see the Manhattan bridge and Lower East Side, while good curtains blocked out street lights and the morning sun while we slept. No troubles with noise floating up from the street. The biggest problem we had was with the heater - I usually had to get up in the night and turn it off, since it got quite warm, but then again, we usually had it on high.

Overall, we really enjoyed the Comfort Inn. It is great value compared to other Manhattan hotels of similar standard: the rooms are, by New York standards, comfortably spacious and very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. We were originally given a room with a connecting door to another room, through which we could hear some noise at night. We asked to move the next morning and this was done straight away, with no problem at all.  The location was important to us as we wanted to be downtown and within easy reach of Williamsburg, so the Comfort Inn was absolutely perfect for that. It was fun being in the middle of Chinatown, Little Italy is 4 blocks away and you can be on the Lower East Side, Soho, Wall Street or Greenwich Village in less than 15 minutes&acute; walk. The subway is 2 blocks away if you need to go uptown. We walked across the Williamsburg Bridge and were on Bedford Avenue within an hour of leaving the hotel (it&acute;s also a short subway or cab ride away).  The breakfast is slightly disappointing but not a huge problem when you can walk 5 minutes to Little Italy for a great coffee!  I would certainly recommend the Comfort Inn to people planning a short stay in NYC and aiming to spend most of their time downtown, but not wanting to spend $300+ a night on a hotel.",4,1,101,Comfort Inn Manhattan Bridge,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1383001-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Manhattan_Bridge-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,6

Overall, its a good day out. Exhibits are interesting and housed in an old POW camp. Lots of information and visuals although some of the huts are quite dark and scary for younger children (warnings on the huts which my cause distress though). Exhibits cover primarily the two world wars, although there are areas dedicated to later conflicts up to and including the present day. There is also an outdoor play area, shop and cafe and several areas (both indoor and outdoor) for picnics.  To see everything, I would say you need to allow about 4 hours, perhaps a little more. As the website points out, the huts are not heated so outdoor clothing is a good idea especially in the colder weather. Site appears fully accessible for all and is flat with well maintained paths throughout.  My only gripe is that they don&acute;t accept debit or credit cards.

Each one tells you about a different part of war - both home and abroad. It is very informative and has lots of information, pictures and models. I particularly enjoyed hut 5 which tells the story of the blitz along with blacked out spaces and smells of smoke. One slight problem is if it is busy you can get stuck in queues as people walk throught the huts - this can be a little frustrating particularly if the people in front want to read every single piece of information.

By the time I got settled in it was noon and I really had a craving for a bottomless cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast. Where am I going to find breakfast at 12 pm?  Thanks to Yelp I found exactly what I was looking for. This restaurant is at the end of a shopping center so it has two walls of windows - light and bright inside, very clean. Decor is warm and charming. Service was friendly and attentive even though they were very busy (obviously a popular Sunday stop).  I had an omelette that could have fed at least two people and it was stuffed full of meat and veggies, they don&acute;t skimp! Most breakfast items were in the $8-$9 range, but every plate I saw go by was overflowing, so they give you your money&acute;s worth. One of my favorite parts - my own coffee pot. Yes, why make me wait till someone comes around for a refill?!  I also appreciated that they have single booths, so it wasn&acute;t too uncomfortable sitting by myself, enjoying my bottomless cup of coffee.  ~Colette www.roamingtogether.com",4,1,101,Egg & I,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33330-d381095-Reviews-Egg_I-Broomfield_Colorado.html,Broomfield,6

The menu is extensive and we opted for one of their burgers with additional avocado, one with french fries and the other with salad. The food was tasty and a generous portion. A bottle of Rose wine came in a little expensive but it was drinkable if not memorable. The server was very pleasant indeed. Many other tables opted for a dessert and they looked huge, certainly enough for two if not three - we passed as the burgers were filling enough.

17130,Bunnydots,Hotels,4/22/2013,Quite nice for a business stay,"My employer selected this hotel for a group of us to stay while attending a conference elsewhere. I had a room looking out on the side of the building so I could see partly the river, partly some older buildings and mountains, and partly an office building next door. If you really want a lovely view, make sure you get the full-on river view or you can also see that from the dining room. As others have said, this hotel is a significant walk from the old town and the other options are to take a boat down the river, which I imagine can be a nice experience in good weather, or some other transportation. During my stay the weather was not good and I was busy with my meeting agenda so i preferred the peace and quiet of this hotel as it is removed from some (not all) of the city noise.  My room was quiet, well-appointed, everything clean, modern and in good working order. Excellent water pressure in shower. Large bed that I found very comfortable. In-room coffee was much appreciated. The desk staff were friendly, nice and very helpful in getting a document printed out for me quickly and at no charge when I needed it in a hurry for a meeting.  Breakfast was included with the room and had a reasonable variety of hot and cold dishes, bread/ pastry, fruit etc. I did notice that the breakfast was definitely better and fresher the earlier you came down to eat - if you got there later into the breakfast time, items ran out or tasted like they had been sitting out a while. They had a chef cooking omelets on one weekday but on other days there was no one manning the chef stations and it seemed difficult to tell on what days the omelets might reappear. There is also good coffee and tea available for free in the reception area all day.  My only complaint is that there was an extra charge for Internet. Since we like most business people on travel use the Internet constantly, it really should have been included in our rate as part of the business package. To be honest, I would rather have Internet included rather than breakfast included, as I normally don&acute;t eat a huge breakfast especially when rushing to get to a meeting, and we had additional food service at our meetings. I also noticed the driveways to this hotel are a bit wonky and the entrance/ exit area is small - not a problem for us as we were using buses and taxis but if you plan on driving here be aware that it may be a little tricky depending on what other vehicles are using the drive area.",4,1,101,Heidelberg Marriott Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187286-d239052-Reviews-Heidelberg_Marriott_Hotel-Heidelberg_Baden_Wurttemberg.html,Heidelberg,6

There was another pool nearer to us so that was fine, and plenty of parking spaces. The grounds are well kept, quite a large lake at the back of the resort although we were quite surprised that it had an alligator in it! The main drawback was that they are still renovating and this caused some noise and lorries coming and going - quite early one morning, this wasn&acute;t quite what we wanted for a relaxing break. Also the lifts have a horrible smell of engine oil in them.

30183,Ellen22,Hotels,9/21/2013,Enjoyable Stay,We recently stayed for a week in this hotel and found it to be very clean and the food was of a high standard. My husband was a bit miffed at having to wear long trousers in the restaurant when female guests were not always dressed suitably. The staff were very friendly mostly except for a receptionist who was a bit surly. We were staying on a Thompson package and the only complaint was that we arrived too late for dinner on the first night and were given a voucher for a meal on the last night. We were due to leave at 6 and therefore could not have dinner and when I asked about lunch she was adamant that it was not possible and that the only option was a picnic which was to be collected at breakfast - I do not think this was a good idea as with the extreme heat and having to carry it around until the afternoon I think it was a health hazard. She said I could ask to collect it later but we decided to eat out instead therefore losing the meal which we had paid for in the package. I think this happens a lot with travel companies and it is something that needs to be looked at. The room was comfortable except for a very hard bed which my husband liked but I found a bit uncomfortable. The bathroom was very clean but the bath had seen better days. The cleaning staff do a fantastic job as do the waiters/chefs in the restaurant. The entertainment was enjoyable especially the comedy Elvis and the flamenco dancers. The live animal shows of birds and snakes were different and provided the chance to see the creatures at close proximity. The pools were immaculate although we are not in the hotel long enough to use them preferring to go on tours to visit other parts of the island and travelling to La Gomera to admire the views and taste the local foods.

It was a fifteen minute walk with very cold windy weather and luggage. but once out of the tunnel the long walk was worth it, it&acute;s a 5 star hotel with excellent decor and beautiful lobby and bar/lounge are behind the reception. The check-in was quite quick even though I had no reservations but given the layout of the hotel the room was far away from the lobby reception area. But once in the room or even the hotel, you hear no planes at all as if your in the city. The room size is very nice with all amenities and coffee/tea makings, but no window to open given the hotel location. The staff are friendly and helpful.

I have stayed in several of the hotels in the CBD and Canal St. areas. The location of this hotel is the perfect compromise. You have a reasonably short, safe walk to the Quarter, close to the lower CBD, Convention Center, Warehouse District, Casino, Aquarium and even the ferry to Algiers Point. Since the hotel is almost on the river, many of the rooms have a river view.  I arrived at the beginning of a holiday weekend and the front desk was mobbed with people checking in. The front desk was well staffed, efficient and processed the people fairly quickly. I am a HHonors gold member, so for my breakfast option was given access to the Executive Lounge. The lounge is on the top floor and has great views, but the breakfast offering was strictly continental with breads, cereal and fruit (no meat or other protein). The Lounge offered snacks in the evening along with a cash bar. In all, the lounge was a great setting with a not-so-lavish spread.  My room (a king) was spacious and well appointed, but showed a little bit of (repaired) wear. The A/C could just barely keep up with the 90+ degree heat. The large flat-screen TV had a decent selection of basic cable channels and several were in hi-def. The wireless internet had decent speed, but I was there during non-business times.  I had requested extra pillows and towels online prior to my arrival and even received an e-mail confirmation of my request but nothing of the sort was in my room when I arrived. I ended up flagging down a housekeeper the next day, who took care of it but if they are going to offer these services, I feel they should honor them.

The room was large and updated with very comfy beds. The bathroom was rather small, but nothing unmanageable. We purchased our room through Priceline and received a very reasonable rate. I would say our only bad experience, had to do with the fact that we stayed only one Saturday night, and the hotel was hosting two wedding receptions that night, which made check-in and car valeting, super frustrating. Once we got to our room, we didn&acute;t notice it too much, but getting out of the main area to go out to dinner was a little frustrating as well.

We were visiting family in Lincoln and wanted a value for money stay. The Holiday Inn Express certainly provided this. On arrival we were warmly greeted and given all the information we needed. The room had everything we needed for our short stay.  The included breakfast makes the room rate very good value. We were staying bank holiday weekend so the hotel was busy. There was plenty of breakfast and all the staff were working very hard to keep up with clearing tables and refreshing supplies.  The hotel&acute;s location is also very good being an easy walk to all the amenities on Brayford waterside and the main shopping areas.

Express hotels before so I knew what to expect. The rooms are pretty similar all over the world. Mine was a bit small (still fine for London) but I was traveling on my own and got used to the size after the first couple of hours. It was clean and functional, exactly what I needed. It&acute;s not a luxury hotel but when you book a hotel room in London for less than 60 pounds you know that. Breakfast was fine. Corn flakes and croissants and a few other items that you find in all H.I. Express hotel and it is of course included in the rate. When the hotel is very busy the breakfast room gets full but there is an additional area to the right of the entrance that guests can use. Staff was fine, did what they could to assist. I had to stay one more day because I got stuck in London during the Volcano Ash fiasco and as others have said, found that the online prices are much better than the ones offered at the desk, but that&acute;s the rule everywhere nowadays. It&acute;s situated in a nice residential area of North London on Finchley Rd right across the street from the tube and with a couple of buses serving to central London as well. It takes about 15min on the tube and about 30min on the bus (always depending on the traffic) to get there. There are 24 hour supermarkets and a few nice eating places as well right across the street.

It is an easy 5 min walk to Finchley Rd tube station which takes you anywhere in London in 15-30 min. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, including a mall across the street with at least 6 restaurants and a grocery store inside. There are 2 pubs across the street too, Australia Bar and Whetherspoons, both nice places for pub food and drinks. A little Kabab restaurant across the street deserves special mention.

The location of the hotel is pretty good-around 6 blocks from the Dupont Circle Metro. This was a pleasant walk on a warm evening through a nice commercial area. It might be more difficult on a rainy or snowy evening. The welcome was very warm and friendly-clearly the front desk staff were well trained. The room was a but faded but clean. i was on the first floor so there was some traffic noise, but I was able to drown it out with the room AC which operated well. The room was without some of the amenities found in higher end hotels such as a sink outside of the bathroom, but had all of the essentials. I received free Internet access which worked well.

I would happily stay there again.  Two issues that need to be resolved: 1> The key cards only work once or maybe twice and then you have to take them to the front desk to get re-set. This was extremely annoying. I was there with a group and we ended up going to the front desk every time we entered the hotel. On top of that, at times the card would work in the elevator but not at your room door, or would open your room door but not the gym. It&acute;s a problem they need to address. 2> This is really the first hotel of this caliber I have seen in which there is NO WATER and NO TOWELS in the gym. Please?  Again- good hotel, I liked it.

I have no complaints about the room and for being such a well known huge hotel in the city it was very quiet. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the elevators. No joke.....plan on waiting at least 5 min for the elevator. Then on the way down or up you will end up making 6 or 7 stops for a total travel time of ten or twelve minutes. I saw other people complaining about it too.....but not the biggest deal",4,1,101,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html,Chicago,6

The bathroom was a shower (no bathtubs at all in this Ibis) but the cubicle felt new and overall the room was very clean. Beds were comfortable but the window above the small bed didn&acute;t seem to close properly and we had to request an extra blanket for our daughter.

7042,Amesthyite,Hotels,8/5/2012,"You know what you get, good value Ibis","We stayed at the Ibis Cl?©menceau in April 2012 for three nights with a 16 month old baby. Comparing to the other Ibis near the train station, this one is centrally located therefore a little bit more expensive. We however got a great deal by booking through the Accor website four months in advance. Breakfast is better than most Ibis, this one actually had a Continental buffet.  The rooms are standard Ibis, however we were given the corner room that had handicapped bathroom. So we had massive amounts of space to put the baby cot however to shower her, it was quite the bother. I ended up having to shower with her rather than get thoroughly wet. This is because there are no baths at all in this Ibis. The train station one has a few bath tubs.  This corner room was very big, lots of space for our belongings, the baby bed was surprisingly soft for a folding travel bed and the sheets provided were fitted. Our bed was a firm double bed (not queen) and the AC was quite reactive enabling us to stabilize the temperature easily.  We found the rooms to be clean, and cleaning service was excellent thanks to a little euro coin we had the foresight to leave on the table. Small gestures can pay.  Overall, good breakfast, good room, good location, buses right across the street and pizza hut at walking distance. Buses can take you to two different malls in about 10 min each way.",4,1,101,Ibis Dijon Centre Clemenceau,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187111-d649824-Reviews-Ibis_Dijon_Centre_Clemenceau-Dijon_Cote_d_Or_Burgundy.html,Dijon,6

The staff were pleasant; check-in was quick and easy on the eighth floor and it was nice to have it separate from the hubbub of the main lobby. We had one of the larger rooms. There were Bose entertainment centers in both rooms and an iPod docking station in one room making it easy to listen to music. The bathroom was a nice size but there was not a separate shower. And there was only a single sink. Water pressure was great. At this price range I expect a separate shower and 2 sinks. Another issue is that a hotel of this caliber should invest in soft-close toilet seats. The club floor amenities were good but not as good as you get at some other hotels. That said it was still a nice club. More and more club floors like this one do not provide alcohol, which is a bit of a bummer.

22641,ClintonJ1,Restaurants,9/27/2014,Good Quality Food in a popular locale,"I make every effort to try and go to independent coffee shops and cafes but on this occasion I was on my own, in the need of a caffeine jolt and something appetizing. I chose le Pain Quotidien for a couple of reasons, one it has big windows and was running a brisk trade and secondly the people inside looked happy and so did the people coming out! How people carry themselves in a place actually says something.... the second reason I selected the place is because it isn&acute;t necessarily the obvious choice for all the tourists that descend on this part of the City - so sometimes you just want something that is not terribly touristey, or at least so I thought.  Table service is provided and you are asked to wait to be seated. Inside is airey and clean as you would expect. Though quarters are a little cramped, it was suggested I sit in the back which actually worked out fine, a large bench against big sash windows and the signature distressed wood tables.  I was presented with three menus, one for brunch specials, the normal menu and a menu that I recall carries liquor or at least wine at the very least. An odd option at this time of the day, but then it is always 5 o&acute;clock somewhere I guess.  The brunches were a little steeply priced and to be frank, nothing really caught my eye. I opted instead for a combination of dessert and breakfast by going for the scrambled eggs with mushrooms and the Belgian waffle.  The eggs and mushrooms came with a toast and a small salad, all very tasty on a large china plate. The toast was a diagonally cut slice from a bloomer loaf and was only supplied with one pat of butter which seemed to be on ration though i daresay if I asked for another I could have had one more.  The Waffle was on the surprisingly small size but very dense and in the end I felt it was sized about right - decorated with a couple of blueberries, strawberries and blackberries.  Try the conserves with the toast they&acute;re great, you have marmalade, strawberry jam and hazel spread to choose from - the hazel spread is sweet but a little of an acquired taste.  As beverages I ordered a macchiato which was disappointing as it turned out more like a double espresso and came with no milk at all but the latte was very good.  Both came in bowls which is the signature for this establishment, the macchiato in a smaller bowl.  If you&acute;re looking for good fare at a moderate price in a predictable chain store then like others in the chain you will not be disappointed here.

The rooms themselves are clean and modern with a nice view and a sort of enclosed balcony over Rue des Ternes but were still really quiet. The bed was so comfortable - wish I could have taken it home. This is not an expensive hotel, however, so don&acute;t expect anything ultra-luxurious or romantic or you will be disappointed.

8918,Aquaplsh,Hotels,6/19/2009,"Great Location, Good Value, Modern","Stayed here for two nights in May. The hotel is in a great location just a few yards from the Ternes Metro stop and surrounded by numerous restaurants. There is also a monprix supermarket next door. It is about a five to ten minute stroll from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elyses.  The hotel itself is modern in design with reasonably sized rooms (by paris standards). In our room there was a mini bar (expensive), tea and cofee facilities (free), a safe (free), flat screen tv (only 1 english channel), direct dial phone and hairdryer. There are a number of comments on here regarding the bathrooms at this hotel. It is correct that the bathroom is separated from the room by an opaque glass screen but is open (no door), so perhaps not the best if you&acute;re not sharing with a loved one... Having said that, the toilet is separate and fully private. The room was air-conditioned and cleaned daily with fresh towels if requested.  The hotel is set over (I think) 9 floors. There is a lift, but it is small and a bit rickety. As far as the decor was concerned, think IKEA and you are about there. The hotel appeared to be well looked after and was clean, although the decor finish wasn;t anything more than average. The staff we encountered were all polite and spoke good English, although they did seem to be more friendly with French speaking guests. Breakfast was typical continental, but of a good standard with plenty of choice. I have seen comments regarding noise at this hotel, but I didn;t experience any problems either from other guests or the (busy) street outside.  There s a lap dancing club next door to the hotel (Stringfellows) but again, I didn;t experience any problems.

It is an interesting neighborhood with a sports arena, government buildings and some charming cafes on the square near the metro. The hotel is very well run and the staff are informative and friendly in the French way. The rooms were on the small side but clean and quiet. The breakfast was basic but fresh and served well. The bar is brightly lit so I would suggest going to one of the nearby bistros if you want more atmosphere.

We were in the east wing and had a partial view of Old Faithful. It was really amazing to wake up in the morning and see Old Faithful go off while in your pjs! The room was comfortable. We did not get housekeeping service the first day until my mom called the front desk late in the afternoon. A young man named Zach was sent to clean the room. He was very personable and very nicely acted like he did this all the time and it was not a problem for him. The second day, my mom found the housekeeping staff on our floor and asked them to specifically clean our room which they did. My other family members had the same type of housekeeping issues during our stay. We knew it was late in the season and that the hotel was short staffed but cleaning the rooms seems like a no brainer. Because we were traveling in a large family group, we had had some issues with our reservations when we checked in. The front desk clerk was not rude but she was not helpful either. None of us liked her or felt like she was listening to us. When I talked to Tom at the front desk the second day, he was very nice and helpful while still presenting a very business-like front.

23207,CorkeyWilson,Hotels,9/12/2013,Quite an experience!,"We stayed just for one night and thank goodness it was! My husband managed to get one of the last rooms in the old part of the Inn at least 5 months before we travelled. We did not know what to expect and were really pleased as we walked into this wonderful old building with its stunning interior. If you go you may never experience anything like this again, so it is worth a visit. The rooms in the old building are quite something but luxury or comfort need to be forgotten. The beds are comfortable and the linens excellent but if you stay you will only have a wash basin in your room with the toilet facilities down the hall (unfortunate if like me you need to pay a visit in the wee small hours) and a shared shower room along the corridor which means you have to take your clothes in with you. The hotel in fairness, provides dressing gowns and the toiletries are good in the shower room and bedrooms, but if you must have a luxury bathroom en-suite this will not suit you at all. We went in June when it was already very hot especially in the small room which required the windows to be open, even at night. No air con of course. The walkway into the hotel went directly passed our window so despite the darkness of the room (no way to put on make-up in the room) as there was only a fly screen and no actual curtains for privacy, we felt a bit exposed. The lighting in the hotel cannot be upgraded so the rooms are very, very dark (take a torch) Our room was also under the wooden staircase which creaked whenever anyone went up or down. The hotel restaurant is fine but nothing amazing and the service is slow because it is full and the staff are obviously asked to be very friendly and chatty with the customers. You need to aware that this evening meal needs to be booked in advance. The bar has an outside area which is great for viewing Old faithful which errupts every 90 minutes and is of course, spectacular. There is also a pianist who plays in the seating areas in the central area of the hotel which is a lovely area to relax in with a drink in the evenings. If you want to walk around the area close to the hotel there is plenty to see, but the best time is early morning when it is cooler. This is an extremely unique hotel and is worth a visit The staff are very good and the rooms and hotel in general very clean. They do have more modern rooms in the rest of the hotel so if you are going for more than one night or are fussy about private facilites, it would probably be best to book one of those well in advance.

We would definitely recommend staying in a lake view room (or higher category) as you get the renovated block which is better. Views across the lake are lovely and the window (full length) opens right out so you get lots of fresh air.  Excellent buffet breakfast included in the price. Very comfortable rooms and well appointed, although not sure how well the air conditioning worked in our room. Quite quiet despite being on the road. Great location as lots of restaurant choices within a 5 minute walk in either direction (to the funicular or the town centre).  Would definitely stay again but worth spending the money on a higher room rate to get more space. Slightly annoying that the wifi code is only valid for 24 hours as we kept forgetting to pick up a new one. Maybe they could look at extending that to cover your whole stay which would make more sense.  Would also like them to open the bar in the evenings - the Garden Bar is good and the staff great but the live music wasn&acute;t the best we&acute;ve seen (!).

4301,ASWh,Hotels,9/1/2014,Lovely location in Como,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Palace Hotel in Como and, from a walk around the town, think we made the best choice. It is worth paying the extra for a junior suite as it looks exactly as on the website (for a change!) and is beautifully equipped and comfortable. Also very quiet, even with the balcony door open, which was a pleasant change for us after being on a busy road in Lugano. The bathroom is heavenly with a large bath and separate shower with &acute;his & hers&acute; sinks and nice toiletries. All very modern and obviously recently refurbished.  Breakfast is plentiful and well stocked/maintained (the best of our trip). The staff were (mostly) helpful and efficient. We had an issue with the wifi being overcharged on our bill - we were told the first day was included as part of our suite rate which was nice, but then it appeared three times on our bill! Eventually this came off but there was a little reluctance which made us feel a little cheap... As with other reviewers, this was the only place we stayed where there was a charge for the wifi, and only one device can be used at a time which meant logging on and off to check emails/internet, etc. A little inconvenient, especially because you are being charged for it.  I would be happy to recommend this hotel as this is truly a four star hotel but it does feel that they only have part of the building advertised as the Palace as you walk through the impressive gates. There is a small bar in the wing where the breakfast room is and the main bar area is the Garden Bar on the roadside. A very nice place and again the staff were great, but the disappointment for us was that it wasn&acute;t open on Monday. It was very quiet generally in the town on the Monday with a lot of restaurants closed which did make for a &acute;small town&acute; feel.

28045,Dougdog,Hotels,4/16/2013,Helpful staff and modern clean room,"Only stayed for one night as we had a wedding nearby. As a chain I rather like Park Plaza hotels and this experience served to confirm that opinion. Large, clean, modern rooms, helpful staff and good in-room facilities. We paid for breakfast at reception but at the restaurant found that it was a tad disorganised - we just walked in and served ourselves and it would have been easy to have avoided paying at all (however, it was a weekend and very busy). Food choice was varied and things like lovely Glamorgan sausages and having actual &acute;crispy&acute; bacon (rather than that almost boiled looking stuff you often get) was appreciated.  Check in and check out were simple and quick and overall the hotel was good value for London.

1960,422,Hotels,10/27/2015,clean and very convenient,we stayed here for 1 night before a transatlantic flight. It was clean and comfortable and more importantly adjacent to the terminal. we were actually flying from the south terminal but its so easy to hop on the monorail we decided to stay here instead of either paying more for the south or having to walk across roads and car parks of getting on a bus.

30149,Ellen22,Hotels,4/13/2015,Impressed,My friend and I stayed at the hotel on two separate nights before and after a short break. On the first night we were allocated a room on the 9th floor and on the next visit it was the second floor. Both rooms were identical and compact. The bed was very comfortable and we were pleased to have a bath / shower in the bathroom. We had breakfast on the second stay and I have to say it was excellent. There was a very good choice and it was presented and cooked very well - better than a breakfast I had in a 4 star hotel in Glasgow at the end of Feb. This was my first stay at a premier inn and if I needed a hotel at the airport again I would book this one. The staff are very friendly and helpful and even with a busy breakfast room they remained efficient.,4,1,101,Premier Inn London Gatwick Airport (North Terminal) Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2667189-d3654125-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Gatwick_Airport_North_Terminal_Hotel-Gatwick_West_Sussex_England.html,Gatwick,6
15723,Botticelligirl,Hotels,3/9/2011,Very comfortable hotel though a little out of the way,"I stayed at the Radisson only one night, on business. I took the DLR as it looked simple on the map, but it was a bit of a trek ??“ luckily I did not have luggage. But the room did make up for the location: it was spacious, with nice modern d?©cor, very comfortable and with everything you need on a business trip including a proper hairdryer, iron and ironing board housed in a little flat wardrobe of their own. The bathroom was large and attractive, with a bath as well as a rain shower; though I did miss a bathrobe and slippers. Toiletries provided in pump bottles fixed to the wall, rather than the usual mini bottles, but including body lotion (bonus points). The large flat-screen TV and Ipod docking station also pleasing, and there is complimentary secure wi-fi in the rooms. (At this level it should be a given, but it isn??™t). There was absolutely no view from my room, but I only stayed one night so I did not mind.  The one thing that I found irritating was that the temperature control did not work properly: the thermostat in the room kept re-setting itself though I kept turning it down, and as a result the room was too hot to sleep in with the warm duvet. I did not feel like querying it with hotel staff as it was late in the evening, and as I couldn??™t sleep I ended up in desperation opening the window. At which point there was street noise??¦ But managed to block it out in the end. I??™d advise to check that the air con works if you are at all sensitive to that. Other than this, the sound insulation seemed very effective and the beds were very comfy. But why oh why do hotels always provide massive pillows?  Now the location is a little unfortunate in my opinion. It is out of the way, not in a pleasant area to wander around in the evening, and although the DLR transport to Canary Wharf or Westferry looks simple on the map, in reality it is a bit of a walk away. They do have a shuttle service to Canary Wharf but only every 20 minutes or so.  I did not have breakfast in the morning, but I would expect it to be excellent given the overall standard of this hotel. I also did not try the spa or any of the other amenities. The service was courteous enough. Of the hotels in this area ??“ i.e. away from Canary Wharf ??“ I would probably choose this one.",4,1,101,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d651411-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Edwardian_New_Providence_Wharf_Hotel-London_England.html,London,6
18667,Calibrator,Hotels,2/10/2011,Ok if your company is picking up the bill!!,"We&acute;ve stayed here previously and chose the hotel again because it was cheaper than other quality hotels more centrally located in Canary Wharf. This is a nice hotel and has a classy, relaxed feel about it from the moment you arrive. It&acute;s also great to see that the management bother to reply to reviews posted here on tripadvisor. There are some downsides though and if it weren&acute;t for it&acute;s Docklands location I&acute;d have to wonder just what I was paying so much money for. The rooms are not that large, mainly because the bathrooms are huge, and we found them to be quite dark and very stuffy. The bathroom/wet rooms are very nice but do take up a lot of space leaving you with an otherwise average hotel room at this price. The position of the hotel means that there are buildings towering over it on either side which ruins any chance of natural light into the rooms. The views aren&acute;t too good either and because of the hotel&acute;s design, the only chance you will get of a full river/O2 view is from one of the expensive suites located at the front. The hotel&acute;s location is a good walk from the attractions of Canary Wharf and it&acute;s not an area in which I&acute;d feel completely happy wandering around at night on my own. This means a taxi everywhere after dark and in case you think of staying in, I was stunned to be charged over ??13.00 for two drinks in the bar. I&acute;m used to paying London prices for drinks but this is steep even by those standards. To sum up, this is a nice enough hotel catering to the needs of business clients who are very likely not spending their own money. If you&acute;re looking to stay in Docklands purely for leisure then I&acute;d wait for a cheap weekend offer to come up at one of the central Canary Wharf hotels where you&acute;ll have a better choice of places to go within walking distance.

I arrived early in the morning and to my surprise they had my room available. William at the front desk was pleasant and friendly and very welcoming. I told him about my nightmare with my luggage (AA broke my luggage and did absolutely nothing to assist me) and he assured me that although the begining of my trip was a nightmare they would make sure the rest of it would go smoothly. The staff remembered me from my previous stays so that is always appreciated.  I may sound a bit spoiled but I must say I was a bit surprised when I walked in the room and did not have an amenity like the previous times. I also had to go on a nightly basis and request for turndown service and for the room to be refreshed.

5436,AffairsinMiami,Hotels,3/23/2011,Great location small room!,"I stayed here on the weekend of Jan 28, it was freezing cold and snowing in NYC but coming from Miami, I was excited about the change in weather.  When I arrived, I checked in immeditely. the front desk agent was nice and friendly but when i asked a few questions about the surrounding area, she was not aware of what i was referring to (I visit NYC quite often and for being an out of towner, I feel I know the city well). I then went up to the second floor and spoke with the concierge for a few minutes. She was helpful, friendly and knowledgable.  My room was on the 9th floor, tucked away in the corner of the hall. I was ok with the location, as it was far away from the elevator and not necessarily in a busy hallway. The actual room however, was super tiny! Dont get me wrong, I was not expecting a suite but just thought it was a bit too cozy for me. I had an amenity waiting in my room since I am an Elite Marriott member and thought it was such an important detail - didnt have to pay the $12 they charge for a large bottle of FIJI water!!  The furniture was damaged and not at its best condition. The bathroom was, to my surprise, very spacious (well appreciated) and the amenities were from Aveda, one of my favorite products!  The door holders and bellboys were great, I have several interactions with them and they were amazing. I even shared a cupcake (hard for me to do since that is probably the only thing in the world I am selfish about!!) with the bellhopper, Alex. He was very friendly and suggested one of his favorite sushi restaurant down the street from the hotel called Ginger.  I recently visited NYC in early March (stayed at a diff property) and came back on the last day of my trip to bring Alex a cupcake, to my very surprise, I was greeted by the same bell hops and they remembered me and wecomed me back!

10508,AyrshireBacon,Hotels,12/7/2014,Great Value (Hotwire) and Great Location,"The &acute;Centre&acute; is one of several Rosen Brand hotels in the area so be sure you are indeed booking the right location wit the correct amenities for your stay, some are resorts and the others are exhibition / business class hotels. Other than that, it&acute;s all good(ish).  We arrived from a transatlantic flight surprisingly fresh and were quickly checked into our pre-booked upgraded room on the twenty fourth floor, which was an oversize room on the executive levels with views over SeaWorld and toward Epcot / Disney in the distance. The storage, lighting and bathroom were all more than ample and the bed considerable in size as well as levels of comfort in a well maintained and clean environment.  Yes there are parking charges but most hotels of this type do and at ??36.00 per night via a third party &acute;secret hotel&acute; booking site there are no complaints here, yes the drinks / food in the lobby stores are very expensive but just plan ahead - you are surrounded by shops inc Wallgreens, Dennys, McD&acute;s with the Pointe absolutely stuffed with restaurants and entertainment just a $10.00 black limo ride away (taxi $7 if you are cheap). There&acute;s a pool, pool bar, spa, blah blah - it&acute;s all you need and more.  Ok downsides are indeed the aircon unit which is a pain in the backside being an older and quite noisy unit - it does need updated - and in our room we had no idea there was room service other than finding a leaflet but no menus. It can be noisy and busy due to the conventions etc which are at the hotel rear, you&acute;ll need to walk through that lot to get your car from the multi-level car park which is a fair distance away - if with a less able bodied person drop off / pick up at the door would be suggested. The executive lounge is close to pointless and why I am not giving the hotel an otherwise excellent score, lifeless...  We would however definitely return and still upgrade the room even with no intention of using the lounge, if booked at the discounted rate. It&acute;s only slightly away from the I-Drive &acute;action&acute; but a great option to consider.",4,0,100,Rosen Centre Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34515-d123526-Reviews-Rosen_Centre_Hotel-Orlando_Florida.html,Orlando,6

The beach is clean and nice, although the coral is very shallow. Remember to take sea shoes with you as without them you&acute;ll do yourself some damage!

As soon as you walk out the of the lobby, you arrive into the hustle and bustle of shoppers and commuters alike. The hotel is also one block away from the world famous Ion shopping mall. Another good thing is that it is extremely close to the MRT station, as well as underground air-conditioned access tunnels, so you can actually walk to places underground with out getting a heat stroke!  Apart from being well located, the hotel was clean and modern. The mini bar was complimentary, and many thanks to the person who thought of putting a Nespresso Espresso maker into the rooms!  The breakfast buffett was HUGE,,,but even so after two days or so it got old. I would recommend going to the food court at the basement of the Ion instead. That was the best place to try REAL Singaporean food..it was a delicious fusion of the some of the best Asian cuisine I&acute;ve had. It practically had everything from Dunkin Donuts to live Sri Lankin crabs. And it was much cheaper than the breakfast buffet.  One down side was that alot of the rooms in this hotel were facing a wall, with no view at all. It was alittle depressing opening the curtains every morning and to face nothing but brick. We asked to change rooms after our second night and ended up facing small alley instead...better than nothing I guess.  When we arrived, the hotel was going through construction.

11050,BMBeer,Hotels,10/20/2013,"Good Location, Comfortable Stay","We stayed here for four nights whilst visiting my sister who lives not far from here. Check in was smooth: as a higher floor room wasn&acute;t available, we were moved to a lanai room overlooking the pool. Initially we were concerned that there may be some noise from the pool or the interconnecting door to the next room, but this was very minimal. Room was well appointed with a sofa and grandfather chair in addition to the bed. It was nice to have the balcony too even if the room only overlooked the pool and other rooms.  Breakfast was over-priced as it is in all of these sorts of hotels and the spread not as good as one would expect for the money being asked for it. It is possible to have a continental buffet ($14.50) breakfast for a smaller price than the full buffet but this isn&acute;t advertised on their menu. Service was friendly but variable and on one morning we had to ask three times for our toast before it arrived. The muffins, however, were delicious!  Reception staff were always very helpful and issues dealt with swiftly (eg a light bulb that needed replacing / our request to check out late). Parking is convenient in a garage right by the hotel and (unlike some places) you don&acute;t have to valet park. There is a charge for wifi but we were given this as complimentary - not too sure why but we weren&acute;t complaining!  The location is obviously good for Universal Studios but also for Studio City, with a variety of shops and restaurants.

A lot of people were disappointed that it was not on the strip. There is a shuttle for $8 cash round trip (the same day), which we did use a couple times, but after the mad house it was trying to walk on the strip at night, I would gladly have just stayed at the hotel. There is a bowling alley and movie theater and other activities that I didn&acute;t even take advantage of, but will next year. I would probably only go to the strip if I had tickets to a show.  South Point is also close to lots of outlet shopping. Car rentals being reasonable, I would probably rent a car while there instead of using the shuttle so I could explore some of the area right around the hotel and head to the strip hotels via the highway if I wanted to go there.  The rooms were very nice - spacious, clean and comfortable. Everyone I encountered from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was very nice.  As we often don&acute;t get out a lot during the competition, it was an added benefit that South Point offered more and better restaurants. The food was better and there was a good selection and the price was definitely better than places on the strip. Did not get to the higher end restaurants, but heard they were all good.

We were shown the Private function room which also provided access to a courtyard garden. This was the clincher! It was a lovely room and if the weather was good, you never know in May, the garden could come into its own.  We booked some time in advance and there was no written confirmation although any telephone enquiry confirmed our reservation.  Nearer the time we dealt with Angela who gave us very good service with understanding and attentiveness. We did need to provide a pre-order as we were allowed to offer choices and with the wonders of the Internet this was not a problem to organise.  The event on the day exceeded ouyr expectations.

22637,ClintonJ1,Attractions,10/11/2014,A buzzing little place with a surprise for jazzophiles,"My wife surprised me with a trip to the Bull&acute;s Head on the river, a short walk from the Barnes Bridge station.  We arrived a few minutes early for our dinner reservation but this wasn&acute;t a problem as at this hour (7pm) the bar is where it is all happening on a Saturday evening. The dining area is a large hall with probably around ten or twelve tables of varying sizes.  The staff are very attentive and the menu although compact, comprises a mix of hearty meals, bar meals and chalk board specials.  Unfortunately the beef short rib was exhausted and so we went with the poussin, the angus steak and a burger with bacon and cheese. Meals arrived in pretty short time and were of normal portion size with chips served up in small enamelware for the burger and steak. The poussin was served on a mound of couscous. Regrettably there was no garnish and had we known this we might have ordered a salad as an accompaniment. The meals were tasty nonetheless.  A variety of beers are available on tap as well as a wine list with some good variety.  The dessert menu is short but sweet and the early grey chocolate fondant was very good although the pistachio ice cream seemed more like a sorbet or milk ice.

It now has a very sophisticated looking bar and dining room. The food is a combination of gastro pub favourites and a selection of dishes from the Jetty Restaurant in Mudeford. Whilst the bar is sophisticated the dining room is less so and a bit somber and poorly lit. The service and food is very good. My partner had twice baked cheese souffl?© to start and I had a classic prawn cocktail. For main course she had battered fish and chips and I had the fillet steak plus mushrooms. We washed this down with a bottle of Picpoul de Pinet and sparkling water. A nice un-expected touch was the birthday pannacotta with candle. Total including a tip was ??118. Warning parking is non-existent and the dining room wall shelf, laden with sauces bottles for the Hotel breakfast, unless it was modern art just looked naff! I suggest possibly better alternatives for accommodation and dining are the sister Christchurch Harbour Hotel or boutique Captain??™s Club Hotel both of which have lovely river or harbour views.",4,2,102,The Kings Arms,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190800-d1154978-Reviews-The_Kings_Arms-Christchurch_Dorset_England.html,Christchurch,6

22629,ClintonJ1,Hotels,2/1/2015,Great proximity for the RG IT Park,"My first stay was primed with a warning from a colleague that the hotel is sprawling and a little lonely however given the really close proximity to the IT park the advantages of location over a social vibe make this a place to give good consideration to.  Over the years I watched the site develop and of course I was pleased when the property was eventually commissioned and opened to customers.  The rooms are very spacious and well appointed, cabled internet is of a good quality and there is a large flat screen TV. Although new, the sloppy implementation of the fittings and fixtures was sloppy and so it is easy to think the place is older than it really is. Annoying things like ill installed roller blinds and crooked light switches and inaccessible blind pulls were annoying.  My room had a hardwood floor and a massive picture window facing the front of the hotel. Tea and Coffee facilities in room are available and there is plenty of clothes hanging space. The in-room security safe was not bolted down which was an odd thing.  The bathroom comes with a nice shower with good water pressure and a robinet for the dual flush toilet. The mirror for the handbasin is heated to avoid steaming up and the towels are in good condition with a bath mat also provided. Toiletries are numerous which is great! Mouthwash would be a great addition but is not provided.  In hotel dining at present is available at the Cafe, the Bar or the main restaurant, the other two facilities were not open during my stay. A la Carte is available as well as a buffet. The buffet is weighted in favour of local cuisine but doesn&acute;t offer much variation from day to day. On two of the six days of our stay we ate a la carte and two days we ate out.  The hotel has a nice pool but not much of a pool side ambience perhaps because of the time of year.  The hotel does not appear to have a gym/fitness centre or at least none could be located. The mini mall is presently not operational so you would need to come with what you need or send out for requisites though the mall is a short walk up the road.  Airconditioning was not operating for the duration of the stay with my room unable to get below a balmy 24&acute;c indoors while outdoors the temperature ranged from 3&acute;c to 12&acute;c. I was told the room- a/c had been deliberately switched off for all rooms to regulate temperature - disappointing...  The staff were very enthusiastic and kind if a little experienced and this was demonstrated in some faux pas during the stay. Great opportunities for improvement.  My final comment is that you will likely have a great stay, if the hotel can improve on ambience and service standards this will always be a great place to stay if for no reason that it is newer and has a good locale for those visiting the IT park.",4,1,100,The Lalit Chandigarh,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297596-d4558938-Reviews-The_Lalit_Chandigarh-Chandigarh.html,Chandigarh,6

31006,Ervaan,Hotels,1/21/2011,Good value for the price,"This is a nice hotel, there&acute;s some renovation going on, much needed because some areas of the lobby, store area and gym area look rather outdated. The prices are OK considering that good hotels in LA are very expensive. It took us a long time to decide where to stay in LA because it is such a gigantic city with so many nice areas to stay. but some of them are so expensive, we couldn&acute;t afford them like Santa Monica, Beverly Hills or Century City. Hotels in there cost +250$ a night, I mean, nice hotels of 4* or something. Staying at the Bonaventure in downtown LA was a great idea because downtown LA is very much in the center of the city and it took a quick drive (avoiding rush hours of course) to go to the beaches, to Century City, to Berverly Hills or even the airport.  More about the hotel, we had problems with the TV set, they had to come and reprogramme it so they gave us free access to the breakfast buffet the next day, without asking, so that was very nice. The next day we got to the room at 8 pm but it hadn&acute;t been cleaned yet! Amazing. The cleaning manager was not helpful at all, as a matter of fact he showed us a lot of attitude. So I went down to reception and complained and they gave us free drinks while we waited for the room to be cleaned. This was nice too. I really dont hold a grudge for this, because the fixed the problem inmediately.  The room was in the upper floor, like 23 or something, it had nice views and the room is very modern and clean. A bit small for US standards. Alll in all we had a great experience and would get back to this hotel if needed.  Parking issues, don&acute;t fight them. The best solution is the valet parking, it is 35$, yes 35$ but it is still cheaper than the nearby parkings downtown.

There is no wireless in the rooms (only lobby area) and the in room wired services is very slow which is not good for a business traveler.

I speak little French, she speaks a little English, but every time I run into her she greats me with an enthusiastic hello. When I was there over the Christmas holidays, she gave me a hand made crochet runner that was the most prized possesion under my tree. Whatever reviewers say about the size of the rooms, take it with a grain of salt, as in the fashion of a hotel in an historical property, the rooms are not cookie cutter, and many have little balconies with great views. I am a runner and love the location for great morning runs, in the last year, they added a new fitness room in the basement. By US standards, the equipment is good but a bit cramped and the ventilation could be improved , but by European standards, it is pretty good. The most recent addition is the Six Senses Spa, also on the lower level. I had a Thai massage there and for athletes, it is an incredible massage, so try it out.

4326,ASWh,Restaurants,5/9/2012,Another visit to the Vin & Maree - perfect service this time!,"I brought my parents to the Vin & Maree in avenue Suffren as I knew we would have a full description of the specials board in english but had flagged with them that it might take a while as the service tailed off last time. I booked a table in advance for 7.30pm and we were the first in the restaurant (so my Dad was very amused that I&acute;d booked...). However, it was full and there were people waiting by the time we came out (it was a Thursday) so worth the booking (and to prove the point to my Dad!).  I think our waiter was called Patrick - he spoke very good English and was very patient at going through the menu, talking about each of the specials and answering questions. We had the shared seafood platter for three which was delicious. My parents then shared the John Dory and it was a large fish and shown to us when cooked and then filleted for them. They both enjoyed it enormously. I had the scallops which are always a favourite and these were delicious.  My problem with the restaurant last time was that they lost interest in us after the main course was served. Am pleased to say that wasn&acute;t our experience this time, we had our wine topped up regularly, were asked if we wanted dessert (no room sadly...) and then he even ordered a taxi for us at the end of the meal.  All in all, a delicious meal again and the service was not only better than last time but properly memorable! Am really pleased we came back and will definitely keep on my list for the future. Very happy to recommend. Prices are what you expect for the quality but it&acute;s definitely worth it.",4,1,101,Vin & Maree,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d720142-Reviews-Vin_Maree-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,Paris,6
4340,ASWh,Restaurants,11/28/2011,Great food but service gets slower...,"Had a great meal at the Vin et Maree and to start with everything was perfect. The head waiter was charming, accommodating and explained everything on the menu in English. The food came quickly and was delicious. We were offered a glass of wine and given the option to change if we didn&acute;t like it. The main course then also came quickly after which things started to go wrong. Nothing wrong with the food, we both enjoyed the flavours and thought both starter & main courses were excellent and good for the money (slightly pricey but nice ambiance). However, we were pretty much ignored after the main course was put in front of us - we had to signal to the waitress to get another glass of wine, the water wasn&acute;t replenished and we asked three times for the bill. We ended up waiting 40 mins to get the bill, this despite them putting people both sides of us and taking their orders. It put a dampener on what should have been a great evening as we felt very ignored after receiving our food. I admit it&acute;s worse to wait a very long time for food but we weren&acute;t offered another drink while we were waiting or any apology. I think they might have been a little short staffed but seemed to have their priorities wrong in resetting tables rather than handing out the bill!  Would recommend for the food but would advise that the service isn&acute;t smooth.",4,0,100,Vin & Maree,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d720142-Reviews-Vin_Maree-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,Paris,6
470,19katy80,Hotels,1/16/2011,Good for the price,"We booked this as a cheap late deal holiday and weren&acute;t really expecting that much for the price - just wanted a week on a nice beach. The beach was, for me, the best bit about the hotel. Some reviews said the beach isn&acute;t that nice, which I don&acute;t understand. The sand is powder soft, the sea is perfect for swimming and getting a sunlounger was never a problem when we were there. The watersports guys are nice and will give you snorkel gear, kayaks, etc and there&acute;s a guy who will take you out on a hobie cat if you want. The snorkelling just off the beach is ok, not spectacular but there&acute;s fish and I saw 2 turtles just of the hotel - one adult and a baby! The free catamaran trip/swimming with turtles is also great - Charlie is a great guide! Back to the hotel - we had a spa room. We were given one on the ground floor. These rooms aren&acute;t especially private as the windows are very close to the pool. Also our shower wasn&acute;t fitted properly, coming away from the wall and hardly any water coming out of it. We asked to move to an upstairs room, and that room was better. Although shower still not great. Having seen the beach, I wished we&acute;d booked a sea view room. It&acute;s worth the extra. Food in the restaurants was good quality. The breakfast was especially good. There&acute;s no vegetarian choice. If you are vegetarian I would not recommend this hotel but if you eat meat, or especially fish, the food is fine. For both food and service, the best restaurant was the Bajan restaurant in the spa section of the hotel. The hotel is a bit in the middle of nowhere. I know it&acute;s all inclusive so guests don&acute;t really need to leave, but it&acute;s quite a small hotel and towards the end of the week we were feeling a little bit penned in so we went out and found a really nice little beach bar/Italian restaurant about 5 minutes down the road. Can&acute;t remember the name, but it is the only one around - its just past the supermarket on the other side of the road. We went in early December and had no problems with insects. Didn&acute;t even see a mosquito the entire week! The pool at the spa was lovely, very cold and again we didn&acute;t have a problem getting a lounger. The service at Waves was fine. Its not a 5 star hotel so we didn&acute;t expect 5 star service. The meeting with the virgin rep (who is based at Waves) was just a sales pitch - don&acute;t bother going, she doesn&acute;t give any useful info that you don&acute;t already have. And the check in chill out service was a shambles, as the rep hadn&acute;t passed on the right info to the check in staff so they didn&acute;t have the right boarding passes! All in all, we had a good week here and think for the money paid (under ??900 for a week all in) it&acute;s excellent value. However, if we go back to Barbados I would stay somewhere else - in a town with a bit of life!",4,3,103,Waves,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147265-d260445-Reviews-Waves-Saint_James_Parish_Barbados.html,Saint James Parish,6
13973,Bingley1,Hotels,12/16/2012,Perfect for relaxation...... something missing though.,"Just returned from a trip to Waves in St James and our overall holiday experience was mixed. I travelled with my wife and stayed in the Ocean Front apartment. The positive points in our opinion are as follows 1) Rooms are very spacious, tastefully decorated and quite modern with decent sized balcony and dressing room. 2) Two free spa treatments and catamaran trip (if travelling with Virgin) must be taken up. Completely relaxing and staff couldn&acute;t have been more friendly. 3) Staff on reception very helpful and friendly. 4) Direct access onto the beach from the hotel if staying ocean front. 5) Within 10 minutes bus ride to Holetown or 15 minutes to Bridgetown with bus stops a 2 minute walk away. 6) Housekeeping was very good.  The negative points. 1) Some of the staff although friendly never seemed to smile. A smile goes a long way and doesn&acute;t cost a lot. 2) Although close to a major town and city we missed being able to go for a walk because it is quite isolated and with the hotel being on the busy main highway you take your life in your hands when you walk on the road because the pavements are hit and miss. 3) Although the restaurant boasts 3 restaurants (al a carte, oriental and italian) be prepared for Bajan versions of all three. We found the food to be hit and miss. Maybe the hotel could change the menu once a week because we struggled over 11 nights. Two of the 3 restaurants are open at any one time so you have to book your table. 4) The entertainment was average at best and finished at 10.30pm. We aren&acute;t party animals by a long way but most nights it was almost as if we were listening to background music. Apart from two acts the rest seemed to be playing to themselves and didn&acute;t really engage the audience who often drifted off before the end and with no bars close by the evenings seemed to drag. 5) Choice of drinks was very poor. The local drinks were ok but if you wanted branded drinks you had to pay which is fair enough but the choice was non existant. 6) If staying on the Spa side of the hotel in the gardens be aware that you have to cross the main road (busy most times of the day). There is a large pool there and the oriental restaurant but I&acute;m not sure if the bar is open during the day (except lunch and dinner times) so you may have to go to the main part of the hotel for refreshments. 7) Two weddings took place whilst we were there and if your considering this hotel as a venue think again. I&acute;m sure the hotel organised things very well but the two locations we saw being used were terrible. One couple were married at one end of the varander which happened to be next to towel exhange area and large wooden fence down one side. The other couple chose the beach. Because of the time the wedding took place the tide was beginning to come in and the bride had to time her run to the altar in between the waves. The altar was placed at the top end of the beach next to some tall metal fences ! I would have been gutted if it was me.  Overall I would recommend this hotel if you want total relaxation. It is isolated in terms of wanting to go for a walk but public transport is there. Sort the entertainment out and we would have been happier. For us we enjoyed our time there although quite a few people we spoke to had numerous issues and weren&acute;t happy. They seemed to be the ones staying in the garden area. If your looking for a lively hotel then look again. Finally put information in reception about things to see and do in Barbados. You shouldn&acute;t have to book everything through Virgin !",4,2,102,Waves,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147265-d260445-Reviews-Waves-Saint_James_Parish_Barbados.html,Saint James Parish,6

Two of the dishes had the same garnish which was a bit tired. The blue cheese fig and rocket salad and dressing was quite nice. The huge fat potato wedges didn&acute;t do anything for me.

Only suggestion is to improve the quality of the artichokes or remove the outer sections. The rose on tap was awful. Sour. The mini deserts are brilliant.

She just told us to make the payment at the hotel itself. When we reached the hotel, the check in was smooth and immediately we were offered lovely tea by one of the staff in our room (on the house). We had booked a Golden Fish room. The room was done in wood, and had a small balcony offering a stunning view. Even the windows were huge. The room was very clean and aesthetically decorated. The bed was king size and very comfortable. We really loved the food. One word about food at their restaurant. The food is like home cooked food and its best to stick to known choices. Breakfast was ok, having limited choices. However, the personal attention and hospitality won us over. The place is run efficiently by a Tibetan lady. Views from the room were awesome and it was nice waking up to the views of the mountains and the sunlight streaming into your room.

Getting to the CityRail wasn&acute;t too bad, but requires a 10 min walk to the Museum Station.  The rooms were fine, the bed was comfortable, and overall everything was clean and relatively new. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful.  The only minor fault would be the lack of affordable wi-fi. It&acute;s available but expensive.

We arrived early for check in and were allowed to leave our cases in storage and use complimentary showers after our flight. Staff were nice and really helpful. Map provided along with some directions. Our room was a deluxe one on a high floor with a balcony. Very spacious, good shower. There were no drawers to store clothes though which was suprising given the size of the room. The Wifi was terrible and expensive. Location wise easy walk to Surrey Hills where there is an abundance of lovely restaurants that you wouldn&acute;t neccessarily go to if you were staying in the centre of town or Darling Harbour etc. We found some gems and were therefore delighted with the location. You can walk to Hyde Park and Darling Harbour fairly easily - about 10 and 20 mins respectively. Opera House too far in the heat. There are bus stops nearby and liquor stores, Internet cafe and supermarket all on the doorstep.

Both sides were fine, but not remarkable. Our daughter had the Grilled Chicken Alfredo, which she let me try. I have never had broccoli/vegetables mixed into an Alfredo before, but it worked, and certainly made the meal less heavy. The grilled chicken was tender and juicy--definitely not dried out the way grilled chicken often is. The Alfredo sauce was not remarkable, but perfectly acceptable. Overall, the meals were good, but not amazing. The main thing is that they know how to cook meat (both red and white) properly!

Breakfast buffet had hot and cold foods and was quite good. There were cheese omelettes, sausages, toast, jam, oatmeal, cereals, fresh fruits, yoghurt, muffins, danishes, coffee and juices.

All of the conference hotels were booked and being in the Napa area most of the hotel properties were out of my price range. I searched the vacation-rental-by-owner-type sites and Craigslist for a place to stay for just the one night without success. The hotels in nearby Vallejo seemed either overpriced or down-right dangerous. I expanded my search by a few miles and found the Cordelia Comfort Inn.  The property did not disappoint! The front desk staff were very efficient (the cookies given at check-in were quite tasty) and the room was comfortable and clean. The walls were a bit thin (I could hear a guest in the room next door coughing, but it wasn&acute;t enough to bother me--especially for the excellent room-rate.  I was traveling alone on this trip and felt perfectly comfortable walking in the area as I decided where to go for a bite to eat for dinner. There were a number of fast food and diner-style options as well as plenty of gas stations near the hotel.  As other reviewers have mentioned, breakfast was a good value with fruit, yogurt, breads, cereals, danish, sausage, eggs, and waffles. There were plenty of options from which to choose!  The parking is sufficient with some on-street parking available. My husband and I often travel with a small cargo trailer, and although it wasn&acute;t with me on this trip, there would have been room for us to park on the side street just next to the parking lot.

Linens were fresh, king size bed, extra pillows, large flat screen and a coffee maker. What more could you want from your room? Although the neighborhood around it might seem intimidating to those not familiar with NYC, it is really a convenient location (basically steps from Chinatown) and subway stop (Canal Street) is a block or so away. The only consideration that may negatively impact some visitors is that most of the restaurants in the immediate area around the hotel are Chinese, so if you don&acute;t care for that cuisine you might have to venture further to find a restaurant. There is a McD&acute;s and Burger King right around the corner, however. Front desk at hotel gave us a good recommendation for a Chinese restaurant which everyone in my group enjoyed.

Food and beverage: nothing to speak of. But for Fiorello&acute;s sake, you&acute;re in the middle of Chinatown, Little Italy, and Soho. Why should the hotel try to compete with the fascinating, abundant nightlife within a few hundred meters of the hotel? Try the Red Egg (50m east) for Chinese, or the Deluxe Bagel (150m south) for breakfast.  Location: REALLY interesting. The shopping is amazing: you can get a Rolex Oyster watch, normally $15,000, for fifty bucks!  Business functions: the Wireless internet in the room wasn&acute;t quite in range.

There no bathtubs in the rooms, although a nice sized shower. They have put in programable thermostats in these rooms , and I really don&acute;t know why hotels do this, as they can be confusing and it can take time to figure out if it is set wrong ..meantime you are cold or hot...better to be able to just set the temp for what you want.

There was still plenty of room to walk around. Also had a closet which could easily store larger pieces of luggage for those staying longer. The bathroom was updated with plenty of towels and toiletries and was very roomy. The biggest downside is that the hotel faces the Ground Zero construction site, so rooms facing that direction will have construction noise 24 hours per day.

A few things are a bit more impersonal, for example, such as there is no reception on the ground floor, just lifts, which makes it feel a bit insecure; check in was quick, but involved the receptionist just pointing me to the self-service machines to get my key card (which didn&acute;t work so I had to go back and get another one).  Room was on the top floor so was quiet. Clean and all the usual facilities. Towels were a bit worn though. It was nice to have a bath - the shower was over the bath. It was generally quiet.  I didn&acute;t have the breakfast because going to Brucciani&acute;s grand cafe on Fishergate nearby is cheaper and more interesting.

It didn&acute;t feel unsafe but it might be an issue for security.

16586,BronwenL,Hotels,5/10/2008,Very pleasant off-strip hotel,"We decided to stay in the Rio for a change of pace. We are in Vegas at least four times per year and like to try different hotels each time if possible. The Rio is a very nice hotel, well maintained but not the best or worst of Vegas. The value for money is outstanding.  The rooms are very large suites with excellent bathrooms. The showers have a glass window looking into the bedroom which is either sexy or disconcerting depending on your perspective (the latter for me). The bed was comfortable, the water pressure excellent, the view okay (over the suburbs of Vegas), service very good. In-room internet access was about the same as most Vegas hotels - $12 for 24 hours or something close. The rooms were a little noisy, we could hear people in the halls almost all the time but there is no street noise.  The hotel doesn&acute;t have the best restaurants in the city but the seafood buffet is good despite being pricey. RUB BBQ restaurant was awful.  If you are planning on being at a convention at the Rio this hotel is a perfect choice. If you&acute;re doing the tourist thing the distance from the strip may be annoying. It isn&acute;t a comfortable walking distance as the hotel is on the opposite side of the freeway. Cab fare is about $10 - $11 to get to the closer end of the strip (Treasure Island, Venetian, Wynn, Mirage, Paris hotels).  All in all, pretty good but not my favorite.

Staff at front desk were diffident in the way hotel staff in certain cities (NYC, for example) seemed to be trained.

18209,CRobDerbyshire,Hotels,7/17/2015,Convenient central location and reasonably good for the money,"You can&acute;t get more central in London than this hotel, which is on Tottenham Court Road near the junction with Oxford Street. I found it to be a very convenient location, only a stone&acute;s throw from the nearest tube station and even within walking distance of Euston and St Pancras/King&acute;s Cross railway stations. The hotel foyer is reasonably nice and spacious, but on my arrival the atmosphere was quite frenetic with tourist groups congregating in the reception area. Nevertheless, I was attended to quickly and pleasantly. With a room on the 6th floor, I had to use the lifts which were in much need of refurbishment.  As one of the cheapest options in London, I wasn&acute;t expecting much of the room but was pleasantly surprised. It was very small, even for a single room, but fine for a short stay. It was clean and the furnishings weren&acute;t at all bad - I liked the wood panelling around the bed area and the single bed was reasonably comfortable with decent bedding. The window was missing curtains, only having a built-in venetian blind, but at least the window had a fairly open view - I could even see Big Ben in the distance but close enough to tell the time. The shower room was also small but manageable and was tastefully decorated with black marble-effect tiles. I had some gripes in that the water didn&acute;t drain away very quickly from the wash-basin and the reading light above the bed didn&acute;t work, but these were minor. Given the location, I wasn&acute;t expecting it to be a quiet room. There was the inevitable road noise, but with the double-glazed window shut the noise was tolerable. There was also very little noise from neighbouring rooms. I wouldn&acute;t have wanted a room near the lift area though as, apart from the lifts, there was a very noisy vending machine there. I didn&acute;t take breakfast in the hotel as there are various coffee shops dotted up Tottenham Court Road.  Based on location, price and quality, I can recommend the St Giles Hotel and I would stay there again - that is, provided they don&acute;t increase their prices, as ??85 for a small, basic, single room is still on the high side and I certainly wouldn&acute;t pay that in any other British city.",4,2,102,St Giles London - A St Giles Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193113-Reviews-St_Giles_London_A_St_Giles_Hotel-London_England.html,London,8

They offer at least two dozen flavors - from the standards to the unique so there is bound to be something to please everyone. They have about 10 tables/booths if you want to eat your treats inside. Good cups of cappuccino and espresso are also available as are wonderful Italian pastries. Small cups of gelato run about $2.95 but are well worth it. And you can mix/match flavors in your cup, so don&acute;t stick with just one. (A combination of chocolate and coffee gelatos is just delectable.) If eating out in Annapolis, don&acute;t order dessert at a restaurant - take a stroll over to Aromi d&acute;Italia and get a gelato or pastry!

11862,Bangkokexpat,Hotels,7/5/2007,Competent. Comfortable. Great Location.,"I stayed at Swissotel The Stamford for four nights during the end of June, 2007. This four star hotel lived up to my expectations. It was competent, comfortable, polite, clean and well-appointed. My room on the 26th floor, was large, modern and pleasant, with all the amenities one would expect. The large bathroom sparkled. The d?©cor, while standard issue, was pleasant. While I had no complaints, and was generally satisfied, the hotel has no particular distinction or character, which is admittedly difficult to achieve in a downtown 70-story high rise.  The breakfast was as varied, ample, and delicious as I&acute;ve had anywhere, and the large, striking, three-story atrium breakfast room, made up in theatre what it lacked in intimacy. Unlike many of its four star brethren, the friendly staff did an excellent job of continuously cleaning my table of plates and keeping my tea topped up. Breakfast was served until 11:00 AM, which was terrific for my schedule.  The major advantage of this hotel is its location. The hotel is attached to the Raffles City shopping mall, which itself is attached to the City Hall MRT station. Through numerous underground air conditioned tunnels, themselves constituting shopping malls, you can walk to The Esplanade, and to numerous shopping malls and a convention center. It is an easy and cheap (about US$1) MRT ride from Changi Airport to the hotel, which is about as convenient as you can get.  In the past, I stayed at the more expensive Raffles The Plaza, which is next door to Swissotel The Stamford, and is also attached to the same mall. I could find no differences in the two hotels which would justify a higher price for Raffles The Plaza.

When I booked it, it was the most reasonable price I could find in the area, in its class. I have stayed in NYC many times (2 star to 5mstar) and this was one of the better stays I have had. Comfortable bed, great pillows, great room, friendly staff. A couple of things I would suggest to the mgt - The bell staff sometimes &acute;disappear&acute;&acute; - staff needs to coordinate together to be visibly available. We had a small baloney off our room... Would have been nice to have some small outdoor chairs out there.

16579,BronwenL,Hotels,11/23/2009,Wonderful beds!,"This is the second time we&acute;ve stayed at the Bonaventure when doing business in LA. As with the first time, we were very happy with the experience. The check in was easy and the girls at the counter had a sense of humor. We checked in very late but they were still chipper. We asked for a King room but when we got to our room it had 2 beds. Turns out there was a computer glitch but we were promptly moved to another room with the king per our request.  Every room in the hotel has a city view and they are all oddly shaped rooms. If you&acute;re expecting a massive suite you&acute;ll be disappointed, but the small modern rooms are well appointed and very clean. The reason we came back to the Bonaventure is because they have the absolute BEST beds. The bed was so comfortable it was like sleeping on a cloud. Bring your own pillows though, theirs offer no support. Even though there were many teens in the building one night for their prom, we couldn&acute;t hear any noise from the streets or other rooms. We found it very peaceful and relaxing. We were able to get a late check out with no fuss and at no extra charge. For an upscale LA hotel, the rates here are very good.  We were working late while we were in town so we ordered 1am room service for dinner one night. The food is very expensive but was delivered quickly by a very pleasant server. Everything tasted good although probably not really worth $18 for a quesadilla. There&acute;s an IHOP 3 blocks away if you&acute;re in need of late-night sustenance. The breakfast buffet is also pricey but excellent. Be prepared for the valet parking (their service is outstanding and we felt very safe leaving expensive art in the vehicle overnight). The cost to hotel guests for overnight parking with in-out privileges is $24 (ouch). For guests it&acute;s $34 but they can get validation at the lobby bar for 3 hours for $7. There is also a large parking structure across the street at Flower and 4th which is probably cheaper.  When we&acute;re in town again on business, the Bonaventure will be the first hotel we consider.",4,0,100,The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32655-d77874-Reviews-The_Westin_Bonaventure_Hotel_Suites-Los_Angeles_California.html,Los Angeles,8

15587,Bookend48,Hotels,1/19/2011,Good value. good location and good night&acute;s sleep,"Stayed at this Motel for a week, extended daily from first two days. Motel is a comfortable and overall good value for it&acute;s two stars.  Basic room which had two double beds, good Sat TV, microwave and fridge. Tea & coffee available in the room and at reception. Toaster would have been a good touch. Was pleased the room had a bath and shower though, not s good for making toast...  Rooms in need of bit of updating and some TLC but functional and worth the money. Motel is directly opposite part of the airport run-way but noise was not an issue at all.  Heating is blow air type which is typical in US motels. Warms up quickly but can be noisy. Air wasn&acute;t really tested due to outside temps.  Free room safe and free Internet (fairly fast and reliable). Free parking directly outside your door. The &acute;pool&acute; is more of a oversize outdoor bath.  On first impression some of the reception staff do seem a bit preoccupied and distant but that&acute;s not important to me and after a while they were friendly enough. they helpful enough to advise me not to put &acute;indecental&acute; charges of debit card as is charged straigtaway, rather to use cedit card.  useful &acute;Bear-bites&acute; breakfast consist of cakes,Bagels, cereal and coffee/tea.  I had read some of the reviews which said about security in the area etc. One day I accidentally left my safe door wide open while out for the day and with my money, passport etc in it. despite the room having been cleaned I returned to find all my possessions were in the room. To the staffs credit these items could easily have been taken and it would have been my error and my word against the Motels&acute;.

The tile is old and worn. The caulking around the old tub needs to be redone. The fixtures are old and worn and kinda dirty. This is really the only bad comment I have. We had a standard room.

20410,ChampagneDoberman,Hotels,12/8/2010,We would return here for another great time in Florida,"We stayed here for 7 nights in late November arriving at Orlando airport and travelling by hire car at nightfall to our destination. (NOTE..! We found the Vista Cay resort difficult to find owing to lack of 1/signs 2/ lighting around the signs and 3/Lack of information on where office was located. We believe some people may struggle to find the resort and also to locate the office to obtain check-in codes to accomodation. We are quite well-seasoned and independant travellers but still had problems entering the complex). As stated on other reviews head straight to the check-in office which is located on the left (as driving from the airport) along the road from the Vista Cay resort on the same side next to the large &acute;Publix&acute; foodstore. This is the Millenium Vista Cay office. We got our key-code entry for both the gates to the resort and our apartment and were offered an up-grade to a Millenium three bed executive apartment at no extra cost. This was on the 4th floor of building 5012 (number 404). I did read on other reviews about a compromise of adequate security at this resort so we sensibly kept our door double locked. This was a very spacious apartment and was equipped with everything we required including towels, very handy washing machine(enough washing powder for 1 wash), dryer and iron/ironing board, huge fridge/freezer/ ice machine, 2 bathrooms/showers, nice balcony looking over the pool area with recliner and chairs. We did&acute;nt use half the space of this accomodation! The Publix store down the road was convenient for groceries and the NYPD pizza place next door was very good and would recommend. We used them for a delivery. The Vista Cay resort was quiet and civilized, very well kept and attractive. The gym near to the pool was well equipped and kept very clean, the best time to attend probably being early morning. We did not use the club house but this seemed always busy with children occupied by playing air-hockey and other games. There is no on-site shop or bar selling refreshments but we used &acute;Wallgreens&acute; which sells most essentials and is located just on the corner outside the complex. The main Disney &acute;parks&acute;, Seaworld, Universal Studios, Gatorland and waterparks are all around 15 minutes drive away. These are all must-sees in my opinion. International Drive is about a 5 minute car journey away or about 20 minutes walk. This area offered lots of entertainment, shopping and restaurants. We dined at a very good Greek Taverna offering home-made cuizine and also enjoyed a meal and good service at Cattleman&acute;s Steakhouse. We hired a Hummer through Alamo car hire. They provided professional service and this was an excellent vehicle. I would recommend this resort and area for a brilliant, fun and memorable holiday with a BIG &acute;wow&acute; factor.

Being able to walk to Arenas Road is a big plus and there are many nice restaurants along the way, including Jakes. The new play area behind the office and the park labyrinth opposite corner of the property certainly make it an interesting place although I would estimate about half the guests there are couples. Room cleanliness has improved noticeably over the years although there is an urgent need for a plumber and electrician. The bathrooms, in particular, need lots of work as they have been remodeled several times leaving gaping holes around the pipes, etc. Although the rooms look attractive when you first enter, you quickly realize the property still needs much work. There are no in-room safes here which is unfortunate. And speaking of unfortunate, the breakfast is hardly impressive. Lots of pre-wrapped pastries that are put out the night before and thereвЂ™sвЂ™ very little in the fresh department. Then thereвЂ™s the pool furniture, some of which is in disrepair and hopefully will soon be replaced.

Although it&acute;s a four slice model, it does not have independent baskets so all four slices (or two bagels) must be started at the same time. So if I come along after another guest has started to toast a bagel, I have to wait five minutes before I can toast mine. I&acute;ve stayed at hotels ranging from five star to the lowly Econo Lodge and haven&acute;t seen a more ill-suited toaster than the one here. Some hotels have commercial tractor feed models that move the bread over the hot coils and others have a less costly four or eight slice model but at least with independent baskets.

But if you depend on electronic communication, you may find that somewhat challenging. It&acute;s not that the wifi is slow, as some have reported, it&acute;s that the routers are located in the hallways and the signal does not penetrate well through the walls and steel doors. If you stand behind the door, you&acute;ll get a strong signal. But as you move toward the window, where the work table is located, the signal fades rapidly. It doesn&acute;t matter how many times the servers are upgraded, unless the signal strength of the routers can be greatly increased, or range extenders/repeaters are installed in the guest rooms, you&acute;ll find the signal to be marginal.  Conversely, your cell phone will work fine on the top (3rd) floor. But on lower floors, you&acute;ll need to get close to the window to get a good cell phone signal, again due to the structural nature of the building.  So bottom line is stand behind the door for wifi and against the window for cellular. Otherwise, enjoy your stay!",4,0,100,Hampton Inn Ft.

Last year the lobby was completely redesigned with questionable results. The comfortable table and chairs arrangment for breakfast was replaced by oversized out-of-place furniture and a high table in the center where superior guests can sit and look down upon the lowly commoners. It does seem a little intimidating at times. And there&acute;s a three way race between the dispiritied breakfast attendants, the toaster or the elevator to see who/what hotds the title for slowest in the land. And speaking of breakfast, can anyone explain why the pitchers of cold milk are placed right next to the hot waffle machine? Despite these oversights and miscalculations, the Hampton Inn on Commercial Blvd remains a convenient and dependable place to stay if you&acute;re in the area.

Also bus 157 takes about 30 mins to bottom of La Rambla, waterfront and then goes on to beaches. Bus stop is just outside hotel. Trams about 5 mins walk connect with metro and local trains. Fares cheap - buy a T10 ticket at the tramstop and use it on all public transport.  hotel apartments are clean, comfortable and spacious. furnishings a bit tired and if you ask for stuff to do your own catering it is very basic but you can manage - just. our standard apartment comprised of living room with kitchenette, bathroom, and bedroom.

But the engineering/maintenance staff is superb and immediately responded to this issue. When we checked in we noticed the toilet in our room was stopped up, and when notified, the front desk staff profusely apologized and immediately an engineer appeared at our door and fixed the problem. The staff is very well trained and very responsive. The rooms are typical NY pocket size, while the room rate is high, and the fitness center is tiny, tiny, tiny.

There was an LCD TV which could be used for internet access as well as for freeview channels.

The clientele varies in age group which makes it very nice for those of us who are a little bit more mature. The only reason for not giving 5 stars was the condition of the room. For the price, the room was quite acceptable although it certainly could have used a little investment. There&acute;s a humongous old CRT television and VCR from the 1980s. The floor is a hideous fake wood vinyl and my feet got a little dirty walking around barefoot.

We stayed in a first floor room in the preferred area on a B&B basis and standards were still as high as ever. The bedrooms and shower rooms are a bit dated, but are kept spotlessly clean and bed linen is changed regularly and towels daily and a daily visit by housekeeping in the evening checks that everything is ok. The aircon does it&acute;s job quietly and efficiently. Breakfast used to be served in the Orangerie, but this large restaurant is now reserved for the fully inclusive guests (mostly Russian) Breakfast for us was in the outside area of Seagulls restaurant (under cover but open to the garden on one side and cooled by ceiling fans, not aircon.) Althought the food was to the usual high standard, we had to go indoors, up and down steps to access the food areas and another set of steps for the drinks ... a bit difficult if you wear light-reactive specs and have trouble seeing the dark grey steps! Also, the salad, fruit and yoghurt selections were not kept in refridgerated shelves and were always cool but never really cold. The gardens are extensive and extremely well kept. There is a large area of beach reserved exclusively for J.V. clients and plenty of shade and very comfortable sunbeds, though there seemed to be early morning reserving of the prime site sunbeds with towels which became a bit annoying. We didn&acute;t use the swimming pool and it&acute;s terraces, but there was plenty of beds and everywhere was kept pristine. The real disappointment was the advertised &acute;free wifi&acute; which is new. It was only available in very limited areas and was very slow,in fact, almost non-existant most of the time. I enquired about paying for the wifi available in bedrooms. This was available by the hour (though once you&acute;ve logged on, the hour use has to be continual, there&acute;s no logging off and accessing the remaining time later; or by the day ... at an enormous cost ... I was quoted 230 EL which worked out at something like ВЈ22. There&acute;s plenty of wifi advertised at bars and restaurants nearby and this was a much better option. We ate outside the hotel most of the time, but did have two meals at the hotel&acute;s Frigolino Italian restaurant. On both occasions the waiter got the order wrong! Some of our choices were good and some rated as only mediocre. There are different areas available for bedrooms, though all rooms are to the same standard.

The only downside in the accommodation is the tiling in the bathrooms; it&acute;s dated and in need of replacing, but the porcelaine and taps are in mint condition and there&acute;s lots of piping hot water. Towels and sheets are changed every day and the staff are excellent. There are three areas of accommodation, charged at three different rates. The Sports Area (cheapest) is located across a busy road and quite a distance from the pool and beach, next there&acute;s the Palms area, this is very close to the nightlife in Naama Bay, so if you&acute;re not a night owl, then you might find it noisy into the early hours. By far the best and most expensive area is The Preferred, situation on the East side of the complex. It&acute;s well worth paying to upgrade to here. The gardens are well tended and the walkways are washed down every day: the whole place is nipping clean. We went bed and breakfast and were very pleased with the buffet facilities at the Orangerie, where there was a huge choice of breakfasts, including an omelette bar where omelettes, pancakes, fried eggs etc. a done to order. There is an enormous pool with ample sun loungers and free towels. The private beach has very comfortable loungers and lots of shade, and again, free towels. Because of shark attacks in 2010, the hotel has installed anti-shark nets along the whole of it&acute;s long frontage: makes for safe swimming but the area is now empty of fish so snorkelling isn&acute;t at all interesting. Depends on what you want, but snorkelling the house reefs was a very enjoyable part of our holiday in previous years, so the nets were a big disappointment to us. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",4,5,105,Maritim Jolie Ville Resort & Casino Sharm El-Sheikh,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297555-d301826-Reviews-Maritim_Jolie_Ville_Resort_Casino_Sharm_El_Sheikh-Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_a.html,Sharm El Sheikh,0

Of course, with so many budget hotels going upscale, Ramada has raised its rates significantly in recent years and may soon be unaffordable too, particularly for longer stays. Housekeeping remains the strong point here as there isn&acute;t a speck of dirt in the rooms and everything is done promptly and professionally. The hotel claims to be environmentally conscious with the usual cards about towel and linen reuse but that really doesn&acute;t ring true. There are only paper or Styrofoam cups wrapped in plastic bags for coffee and bathroom use. And the lobby, for some unknown reason, is excessively air conditioned to meat locker temperatures. Most hotels in Waikiki, including luxury properties, have open air lobbies. The Ramada, owing to the building&acute;s ancestry as Holiday Inn, chooses to refrigerate the lobby, especially by the elevators. By keeping the front doors open and replacing the window near the elevator with louvers the delightful island breezes would waft through and countless kilowatt hours would be saved. All in all, however, this is a good hotel where I&acute;ll probably be staying again.",4,2,102,Ramada Plaza Waikiki,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87018-Reviews-Ramada_Plaza_Waikiki-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,Honolulu,0

12238,BarryBethal,Hotels,12/12/2010,Very Good Hotel in a Very Good Location,"Stayed here for 5 nights in December. I can&acute;t really comment on value for money as it was a rewards night stay with the loyalty scheme, however, out of interest I had looked at prices on the website and did look expensive for what it was but that&acute;s supply and demand I suppose.  I don&acute;t really understand the issues regarding staff friendliness to be honest. The members of staff who we spoke to/had dealings with where very friendly and efficient from check-in to concierge, bar staff and the turn down lady. You could see there were maybe one or two periphery members of staff (by that I mean staff who you can tell aren&acute;t in customer interaction roles) who didn&acute;t really look the friendliest but hey ho - that&acute;s not their bag.  Room size was very good, rooms simple but tastefully decorated. We received an upgrade to a higher floor and access to the club lounge which I wasn&acute;t expecting due to the stay being rewards nights.  Location is absolutely spot on and the middle of everything! Concierges (and Keith the Bar Tender actually) were very good at recommending the best way to get to certain places and suggesting the odd bar/districts to visit for the evenings.  On the whole a very good hotel which I would definitely stay at again (unless I fancied a change of course), though I would base this on getting what I consider an acceptable rate for the star-rating of the hotel i.e. not the $400 rate I saw when I looked.  To balance the review out, the negatives I encountered would be: 1) That the temperature control in the rooms was a bit woolly and we seemed to wake up at about 03:15 (the witching hour!) every morning absolutely boiling hot even though temperature control would be turned down. 2) While we received free wi-fi in the hotel room as part of the loyalty scheme (which was much appreciated of course) I needed to print off a single page e-mail with a reference code for the City-Pass we ordered that morning (the place where you pick it up won&acute;t just accept the code on the back of a fag packet, they want the actual e-mail).

Hotel is a little tired the only minor niggles are that wish they had satelite tv with english channels and that the bar was much bigger to accomodate the guests  Staff are amazing Juan the manager, Carlos on the bar is simply the best full of whit charm and very friendly.  Kahlid and Karim in the restaurant are great and been here a long time they always greet you with a lovely welcoming smile food is good but as gone down in variation  One of the cleaners must ask her name as a beautiful smile and is very friendly  Sam on entertainment goes that extra mile is friendly and helpful  Looking forward to the smoking ban 2nd January 2011 the bar isn`t big enough to accomodate the smoke it`s like a fog at times and not fair on the non smokers or staff on the bar.

This hotel has it all inside the complex so you don&acute;t really need to leave the hotel for anything except to check out the night life on the strip.  Check in took longer almost 25 minutes, there was a counter for IHG gold members but it was unmanned, then there were 6-7 people behind the check in desk yet serving only 4 customers for some strange reason.  The rooms are big, spacious and clean with a flat screen TV even in the bathroom. My room had 2 double beds, sitting area and a working desk which I am told was kind of standard rooms for this hotel so lots of space for the money. Al though in room tea/coffee facility was missing which is fairly expected at all hotels now days,  Being a casino hotel you bump into a huge number of people at the gaming lounge which you have to walk through if going into the main lobby.

The rooms are of average size and have good sound isolation. It&acute;s also pretty clean as expected from a 3+ star hotel.  The parking garage in the basement has a narrow entrance that requires driving on the left side. If you missed the sign and drive on the right side, it could be difficulty to back up from the ramp if someone is coming out, as the way back involves a rather steep ramp and a turn.

15327,Bon_voyage79,Hotels,1/10/2008,Wonderful Location - Adorable Hotel,"I stayed here last winter with my best friend on our first trip to London. We LOVED it!  Overall, the best thing about this hotel is the location. It is close to all the conveniences. There were several grocery stores close by and that&acute;s where I bought almost all my food. Sommerfield was my favorite and it had lots of yummy ready-made sandwiches and crisps and candies and yogurt. I enjoyed trying the different food and the prices were actually not bad. I had brought a bunch of food with me thinking that everything was going to cost an arm and a leg, but I was pleasantly surprised to find better food prices than Chicago (where I was living at the time). Bottled water is especailly cheap in London! My roommate enjoyed the fact that there was a McDonald&acute;s close by as well. There were several other fast food places but we pretty much stuck to Sommerfield and McDonald&acute;s. There is also a Barclays (bank) right there and I believe that they do not charge a service fee. Yay! And then of course, the location is prime because of the Earl&acute;s Court tube stop, just a few minutes from the hotel. It was a quick ride into the main tourist spots (10-15 mintues probably) and SO easy to use.  The hotel itself was also quite adorable. It&acute;s true that the rooms are small, but you are in Europe. We expected small and were actually surprised at how big our room was. Not big by American standards but bigger than what we were expecting. We had a bathroom, two twin beds, a TV, desk, and still some room to walk around. I can&acute;t say that the beds were especially comfortable, but they did the job. And the best part was that we had the cutest little balcony that looked out onto a large lawn and what looked like beautiful brick apartments. It was February when we were there so we didn&acute;t spend a lot of time on the balcony but it was nice knowing it was there and it also doubled as a fridge at night and we could put our goodies from Sommerfield out there to stay cold.  The only negative I can say about this hotel is that the staff was not the most friendly. They were pretty snappy with us when we checked in and we were put off trying to talk to them the rest of our vacation. But this wasn&acute;t a big deal. It&acute;s nice if they are nice, but I don&acute;t usually ask many questions of hotel staff anyway.",4,4,104,BEST WESTERN Burns Hotel Kensington,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d192138-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Burns_Hotel_Kensington-London_England.html,London,3

IN the end, we stopped trying to argue about it and just told them to charge us for Absolute, when the final bill came all the drinks were taken off. The japanese habachi was good, but our favorite was the Italian. Our all inclusive package also included the food on the beach which was really nice and convinient. We had an ocean view room on the 3rd floor, which provides the nicest balcony of all the rooms. For breakfast the JW Marriott is a better option, better food and mimosas were included!

They offer other meats/proteins at breakfast, but I really like the Hash and at this place it&acute;s delicious.  The front desk clerks are the best in the business.

This is a relatively new hotel, I would guess only a few months open and they still have a few opening pains.  The hotel itself is really nice and the room they gave me was wonderful. I am a Platinum Member of the program and the staff really didn&acute;t understand a Platinum Member which was fine with me, since 99% of the staff at all Holiday Inn Express nationwide have no concept as to what a Platinum Member really is.  They gave me an upgraded room, which again, was wonderful. The shower was awesome. In the 1 night that I was there, I took 2 showers. Great shower and I like a great shower in a hotel. I used the exercise room which was fine, not off the charts, but good.  There may be good news or bad news on this. The breakfast at this brand new hotel is the same crap you get at all the other Holiday Inn Express hotels. I am not sure if that is good or bad news, but suffice to say that is the breakfast. The morning I ate at the hotel, the egg dishes had been burned as the edges of the omelett were dark brown and black.  I find it hard to comlain about a free meal, but they could certainly do something better. My bottom line, would I stay at this hotel again. YES, is my answer. The hotel provided me with what I wanted and they had an exercise room, which is important to me. The staff are, across the board, very helpful and very nice. One perhaps unfair comment is that I thought the front desk clerk should have ironed his shirt before work. I just think the front desk guy should be looking the best they can with nice crisp clothes and a healthy smile. I know the fact that his shirt looked like an unmade bed was there, but I wear a crisp white or blue shirt daily and I think others in the business world should do the same.

The front desk staff are also consistently very nice and have never had any problem accommodating my requests.  As of my last stay in November, the hotel is still in the dark-ages with the TV. Yes, there is a nice big, flat-screen. But there is an extremely limited choice of channels, and the TV appears to still be cable-converted analog. You can do a decent pay-movie if you donвЂ™t mind the charge, but trying to watch network or cable (what little there is) is pretty bad. You would think they would realize that many business travelers watch TV at night and try to accommodate them.  This property has a wonderful fitness center, which is a must for business travelers. Hotel bars are also important. :-) The bar was really crowded one night, and I ended up ordering room service because I couldnвЂ™t even get close enough to order. The second night I had no problem getting drinks and food, and both were excellent. Over the years IвЂ™ve learned that it all hinges on the size of the current conference so I just adjust.  As a long time guest, one thing I would say to future guests is that this hotel is primarily a conference hotel, so I think your experience with the hotel will depend on the amount and type of people at the conferences.

IвЂ™ve reviewed this property before, and the hotel and I still have a good relationship for the most part.  I am based out of the hotel when IвЂ™m on business to the area, but there is usually some kind of conference in the hotel when I stay. Being in this hotel during a conference is always an interesting experience. This time there was a VFW Conference. They were a lovely group. (Not nearly as interesting as the Anime group on a previous visit, though!)  I usually stay on the 15th floor in a bi-level executive suite. The rooms are comfortable for me, and housekeeping does a good job. It is nice to have continental breakfast and evening reception in the lounge and the attendants are quite pleasant. Usually I have a drink or two at the lobby bar, but this time I used the mini-bar. I had terrible luck with getting it refilled during my stay. I guess it isnвЂ™t like housekeeping and checked daily.  I like the quietness of the bedroom upstairs, but it is usually way too warm in the summer. ItвЂ™s hard to blame the hotel for Texas heat, but IвЂ™ve stayed in other places that can cool down the rooms so IвЂ™m still not sure why this one has so much trouble.  Wireless internet was sufficiently fast for me, and itвЂ™s a good thing since the TV is still so limited at this property. The channel selection is actually one of the worst IвЂ™ve seen in my travels. Maybe it isnвЂ™t a priority for the hotel since I imagine most of their conference attendees rarely go back to stay at the hotel. But for those of who stay often it would be nice if they would actually get good cable access.  All that said, this is a consistent hotel. Is it perfect? No. But the desk clerks are pleasant and welcoming, the bartenders are very nice, and the housekeepers always greet guests. The location is great with so many restaurants and things to do close by. IвЂ™m sure our relationship is here to stay.",4,3,103,InterContinental Dallas,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109412-Reviews-InterContinental_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html,Dallas,3
20567,CharlesDP,Hotels,2/11/2011,Great value and excellent service from club lounge staff,"This is a great value 5 star hotel. Admittedly it is starting to show its age in the rooms but they have updated where possible and everything is clean and in perfect working order.  The hotel is not too far from the attractions in Kowloon but it is a bit of a walk to the MTR, say 10 minutes. We stayed in winter so this was not a problem but in summer you might find it a bit far too walk in the heat. You can walk out of the hotel onto the avenue of stars and to the star ferry in about 15 minutes. The avenue of stars isn&acute;t that great in my opinion, too many chinese tourist groups milling around taking photos.  The club lounge for $HKD 660 a day is great value for two people. It includes breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapes as well as in room wired and wireless internet. The service in the lounge was warm and friendly and the food delicious. The attendants were always keen to serve you drinks or take your order. I didn&acute;t actually have any contact with the concierge but instead asked the lounge staff for recommendations, this worked out very well.  In addition to a wide range of items on the breakfast buffet in the lounge you can have hot dishes made to order, like omelettes or french toast. The breakfast and afternoon tea buffets don&acute;t change much from day to day but the evening cocktails vary greatly from night to night. They have great bar staff of an evening that make cocktails to order.  The rooms are looking a bit old but have every comfort you would need and are clean and well maintained. The rooms were serviced twice a day and all requests for additional items were responded to very quickly.  We enjoyed our full harbour view room which had a great view over to HK, admittedly not a view of central but still a great view. We had an executive harbour view room which is the ambassador upgrade if you book a harbour view room. The room is slightly bigger than a standard room and on the corner of the building with rooms numbered xx35. I didn&acute;t stay in a standard room but the size of this room felt just right, any smaller wouldn&acute;t be as comfortable.  We did use the airport limo pick up service and were taken straight to check in on the club floor and greeted by name upon arrival. This was a great way to start our stay at the GS.  An important point for priority club members is that they allow you to keep your upgraded room on reward nights for no charge. I combined a paid stay, on ambassador weekend certificate, with reward nights. I arranged all of this by email before arriving so there were no surprises on check-in and everything went very smoothly. The reservations office responds promptly to emails so it is worth making contact before your stay to ensure everything goes as planned.  I felt that this hotel was very welcoming and I felt relaxed here over the four days of our stay. It&acute;s not as luxurious or modern as the other IC but I liked this hotel.",4,1,100,InterContinental Grand Stanford,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294217-d305810-Reviews-InterContinental_Grand_Stanford-Hong_Kong.html,Hong Kong,3

However things improved massively when I got to the room; rooms were large and well appointed. The bathroom was very good, with a double sized shower. It looked like there had been a recent refurbishment. I was travelling with a group of colleagues, and we had dinner reservations, however the restaurant said that they couldn&acute;t handle such a large group, so we ended up eating in the bar. I did have some initial disappointment at this, however that quickly subsided when the food was brought out. The bar food was excellent, and there was an extensive menu to choose from.

I am not sure if it&acute;s management or ownership, but clearly there has been changes.  I first look at the chips and salsa in a Mexican Food place. The chips and salsa at this place are top notch. They accommodated our request for more spicy salsa, but the regular salsa is just fine. One of the better salsa&acute;s that I have had.  I found the pork taco&acute;s to be just OK, not the best. I did like the beef chalupa. My family had ordered the fish tacos and beef enchiladas, both of which were said to be good. What I did notice is that the restrooms were spotless! They were fresh and cleaned, which is a big change from before. The restrooms were very impressive and a nice change.  I would suggest the more traditional Tex Mexican dishes with beef or chicken, rather than the pork.  Enjoy this place, it&acute;s a lot cleaner now than before and inviting to return.",4,1,101,Los Toltecos,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g30226-d1651155-Reviews-Los_Toltecos-Alexandria_Virginia.html,Alexandria,3

The couple with us had a burrio and the beef tacos. Everyone like the food and I thought the chips and salsa was very good. I give an A- to the guacamole, I prefer a little more cilantro in my guacamole and I like tomatoes in it. As I said, It&acute;s still an A, but A- in my book.  As always, I ask myself, would I go back. The obvious answer here is yes. When we want Mexican food, this is the place we go. I seriously doubt you will be disappointed.

However I would agree about the pool, which is itself a good size, but there is mould growing on the ceiling. Thanks to the very cold weather, the rooms were cold on arrival - and note that putting the fan on 3 turns it off, fan on 1 is the top setting - watch out!

We arrived late on the 21st, about 9pm and everything was ready for us, keys and all.

The room overlooked the business park across from the valet entrance and the bridge to South Coast Plaza, nothing overtly special. One odd thing I noticed in the room was the air conditioner. At night, due to a lack of movement, the air conditioner would turn off and the room was would just start to bake. Next day, we had maintenance come by and they turned off the motion sensing function. I feel like that was taking being environmentally friendly too far and at the expense of the guest, as I felt in my last stay here. The bathroom was clean, could have been a little nicer, but decent. The next morning we got up and spent the day at Disneyland, and the pool was nice to relax by and swim in after a long day of walking. Parking at the hotel was reasonable, with Valet at $30 and Self-Parking at $21. We valeted our car and they were very swift retrieving our car whenever we requested it to be pulled around. Overall, this is your typical business hotel in Orange County, and I would stay here again. We got the hotel as a steal in Priceline for $80, but I would consider paying the rack rate, around $200.

The rooms are modern and look appealing to the eye. Westin Hotels have gone to far with going green. I understand about being eco-friendly and all but cutting down the quality of services has to go. The showerheads get turned off, replacing trash bins so you can only recycle only recyclable products has to go, not good for the advertised 4-stat hotel. Westin... you need to take this away.

Sounds better in writing than it is in person.  The creative director of the hotel&acute;s design firm was allowed to go way way way beyond what other W&acute;s that I have had the privilege to stay at worldwide ( San Francisco and Hong Kong for example) where the design was fun and not distracting. The other properties don&acute;t take themselves too seriously , in a design sense, and I liked spending time in the airy and bright spaces. This W&acute;s guest room design doctrine is just dark.  The public spaces are better. The staff are some of the best that I have ever interacted with in any hotel, worldwide, of any brand.The bed was great. The shower was wonderful. The location is absolutely perfect.  I would stay here again. I just hope its after they redo the guest rooms.",4,1,101,W Istanbul,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d814852-Reviews-W_Istanbul-Istanbul.html,Istanbul,3
12998,Belgian_EU,Hotels,5/22/2012,Fantastic staff at the W,"So having read some of the reviews, I wanted to give my opinion of this new hotel in the centre of London. First, it is a W. I wouldn&acute;t stay here for business. Second, it&acute;s in London. So you don&acute;t get a swimming pool and you don&acute;t get enormous rooms. Third, it&acute;s at Leicester Square. This is tourist central. So you don&acute;t get quiet and you do get hordes of tourists wandering around outside.  Lastly, it&acute;s a hip destination. So there&acute;s a nightclub on the 1st floor that&acute;s pounding until 4am. There&acute;s disco music piped at you and everything&acute;s dark and moody and cool. So if you want a Sheraton, or a Westin, don&acute;t stay here.  If you want a cool hotel for the weekend, close to Soho&acute;s attractions, with friendly and helpful staff who always had a smile for me - then give it a try. You will be mixing with the cool trendy set of London and the international jet-set.  The standard room is small, but I&acute;ve had smaller. Excellent shower and toiletries. Ask for a room at the back of the hotel if you are disturbed by the noise from the club.  Just two annoying things. First is the wifi charges. Hotels all over the world charge far too much for the internet which, these days, is essential. Second, the light switches. Confusing and takes far too long to get everything to switch off at night.  So know your hotel and know why you&acute;re going. And if you want a fun time, try the W.",4,3,103,W London Leicester Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1718977-Reviews-W_London_Leicester_Square-London_England.html,London,3
13005,Belgian_EU,Hotels,7/10/2011,Very sleek and stylish hotel,"We stayed two nights over the weekend at the W in July 2011 and I was very impressed. Firstly simply due to the number of staff, which is unusual in a hotel in Europe. From enough people at reception (on the 1st floor, not the ground) to the waiters fussing over you at breakfast, it meant that things got done.  Be prepared for the hotel to be extremely cool. The staff are well-dressed but almost to a fault helpful, welcoming and available. Josh in particular welcomed us to the hotel with charm and style, while we were being checked in. Not the cheapest place in the world, but you get what you pay for.  Be warned that the club in the hotel can get loud. We had a room on the 2nd floor but on the opposite corner, and whereas you could hear (and feel) the music as you got out of the lift, the room itself was extremely quiet. And the bed very comfortable.  One downside was that the Wifi was not free in the rooms. The hotel has done the usual bad deal with Quadriga (horrible people) and it&acute;s GBP16 for 24 hours.  Breakfast in the Spice Market was excellent with good coffee, fresh orange juice and very attentive staff.",4,1,101,W London Leicester Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1718977-Reviews-W_London_Leicester_Square-London_England.html,London,3

13063,Benjamin_S,Hotels,1/4/2013,Comfortable Stay outside the Centre of Paris,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of a Leger New Year Coach Tour to Paris.  Location The Hotel is about a 20 minute coach ride to the Eiffel Tower without any substantial traffic. There are limited shops, restaurants in the immediate area.  Hotel The hotel looked smart from the outside and was clean and spacious on the inside.  Room The room (112) was a decent size and looked onto the internal courtyard. The bed was excellent, extremely comfortable. The usual toiletries and tea and coffee were included. There was adequate storage for the length of our stay. There is a mini bar but you have to get the key from reception, same with the safe.  Food & Drink We were on a bed and breakfast rate. It was quite busy at breakfast as there were other coach tour parties staying at the Hotel which meant things did run out although the staff did seem to do their best to replenish. The croissants and baguettes were really tasty and on the whole breakfast was pretty good. There&acute;s tea, coffee and juices available, cereals, fruit, yoghurts, ham and cheeses as well as bacon, scrambled egg and small sausages.  Staff Didn&acute;t have much interaction with the staff apart from at breakfast where they seemed pleasant enough.  Overall If you have booked a coach trip to Paris and are staying at this Hotel, it is perfectly adequate and comfortable. The fact that it is not in the centre of Paris doesn&acute;t matter as the coach drops you off and picks you up.  If you are taking a trip to Paris and want a Hotel near the sites then I would not recommend this one as I wouldn&acute;t want to have to make the journey without the comfort of an included coach. The extra price of staying closer to the centre of Paris may balance out with the travelling costs to and from this Hotel.",4,4,104,Holiday Inn Paris Versailles Bougival,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g227609-d228029-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Paris_Versailles_Bougival-Bougival_Yvelines_Ile_de_France.html,Bougival,5

Vanuit het hotel loop je zo de terminal in, en bent binnen 10 min bij de gate.  Alleen...... de kamers blijven warm, dit probleem kent het sheraton nu al meer dan 5 jaar, en helaas wordt hier niks aan gedaan. De recente renovatie heeft in mijn ogen niet veel positiefs toegvoegd aan het hotel. Ben er in de tussentijd 3 x geweest, en in elke kamer was er wel wat, lekke badkamer, slecht sluiten kast deur ( lichtje in de nacht) Daarnaast is de mini-bar verdwenen sinds de renovatie en ik blijf dit erg jammer vinden, zeker voor een hotel die pretendeert een 5-sterren hotel te zijn en makkelijk rond de 260 euro per nacht rekent.

Met prijzen van vaak boven de 230 E, vaart dit hotel wel bij zn locatie. Direct uit het hotel zo in de aankomst is erg prettig wanneer je een vroege vlucht hebt. Echter de kosten voor een kamer zijn buiten proprotioneel voor wat je ervoor terug krijgt. NA een completen &acute;overhaul&acute; van de kamers, is de mini-bar verwijdert van de kamer. Je kan nu met je kamersleutel naar de ligt lobby, op je verdieping en daar in een machine je keuze maken. Wanneer je zoals ik laat nog wel eens trekt hebt, kun je of met je badjas en je sloffen of je weer helemaal aankleden, en je vervolgens vervoegen in de openbare ruimte. Voor een 230+ per nacht mag je verwachten dat dit goed geregeld is. Dan de quick-checkout, hoe erg handig is dit, kaartje invullen en in de bus gooien. Helaas werkt het doorsturen van de rekening soms maar matig, en loop je soms het geld ( expenses) mis als je dit niet in de gaten houdt.. Je moet er dan weer achter aan om je digitale rekening via email te krijgen.  Ook dit vind ik voor 230+ per nacht niet aangenaam. kortom, vanwege de locatie een geweldig hotel, die soms de kop een btj laat hangen, vanwege het succes en de goede ligging.

For mains we all had the beef which was well cooked (rare) and servied with ample veg (however, it could do with more options rather than a lot of a few).

Having read the reviews here, we ensured we booked one of the renovated rainforest rooms and it was lovely. As we had a relatively long stay, it was a great idea to change rooms as the atmosphere of each was very different.  The wildlife in the rainforest was a real highlight (took a torch and did our own animal spotting on the way home each night, having done Dev&acute;s walk!) but being in a room literally over the water was a treat too (slightly older rooms but still very nice). The standards of cleanliness in both were second to none and the staff at the resort are all super friendly which creates a welcoming feel.  We were very pleased with the meals we had - the only restaurant we didn&acute;t try was the Japanese. For a longer stay, it was nice to have a variety of options each evening. The room service was also very good. Nice to be able to get wine, by the glass or bottle, with our meals too - that can be a rarity in Asia!  As the Oriental Village shopping area is so close (the resort shuttle will take you there and back), it was great to be able to pick up our own beers/spirits and snacks to reduce cost.  The shuttle service is excellent but we actually loved being able to walk around. It balanced the lazing around and indulgence!!  All in all, we were really happy with our stay. A word of warning though...just as we left after Christmas, there was a marked difference in vibe and service levels (the staff seemed to struggle with the volume of people) - being a large resort that is popular with families, peak season makes a big difference.

19083,Canadagrrl,Hotels,2/4/2011,"A great choice - value, service and comfort","I&acute;d rate this a 4.5 if is was possible. Stayed for 4 nights in late January, on a trip with a girlfriend. We had a room with one queen bed, and while it was not spacious, there was enough room for us to store our things and move around without problems. Bed was comfortable, linens of decent quality. The bathroom was a good size (though a shelf in the shower would have been nice!) The room, bathroom, hallways, elevator and lobby were clean, and the staff were very good - we were able to check in 4 hours early, and housekeeping was great about fulfilling small requests (extra towels, giving us conditioner as well as the provided shampoo.) Breakfast had a limited selection but was adequate - basic fruit, hard boiled eggs, make-it-yourself waffles, bread, bagels and muffins, juice, coffee and tea. I&acute;ve definitely had worse in better hotels. Free wifi.  Well located for subway access to midtown or DUMBO in Brooklyn, and an easy walk to the Lower East Side, Chinatown, Nolita and Soho. The streets are very busy in the day, and fairly quiet at night, but well-lit enough to make me feel safe even without a lot of people around.  Best part about the room were the windows - a long and a short wall with floor to ceiling windows, facing south and east (no balcony access, but it was January!) During the day it was sunny and let us see the Manhattan bridge and Lower East Side, while good curtains blocked out street lights and the morning sun while we slept. No troubles with noise floating up from the street. The biggest problem we had was with the heater - I usually had to get up in the night and turn it off, since it got quite warm, but then again, we usually had it on high.  We paid $80/night (taxes in), which was incredible value for what we received.",4,1,101,Comfort Inn Manhattan Bridge,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1383001-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Manhattan_Bridge-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,6

Check-in was quick, Megan was friendly and professional and within five minutes I was in room 1203. The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. The bed was plush and great for a nap. I even had a view of the airport. There is a main road running next to hotel but the noise was not even noticeable. The bathroom was plush and clean and they have robes and slippers in the closet for your use. The complementary WiFi in the room and lobby is fast and reliable and the TV selections were good to pass the time as well as a coffee maker, microwave and mini fridge for your convenience. There is not much around the property for food but they have an adequate selection in their market in the the lobby as well as their Bistro selection for food and drinks are good. The hotel has recently been refurbished and very well done. The lounge area in the lobby had comfortable seating. The day-room rate was $125 plus taxes and the rooms are available (if available) from 10:00am through 6:00pm.

The bartender there is hilarious go have one or two drinks before you go out and he will tell you the funniest stories. His mannerisms kept me laughing for ten minutes straight. Really nice guy. The room was decent, bed was good, bathroom was a little outdated and small, they need to reseal that tub.

Good location a couple of metres from Tower Hill tube station. This is probably more of a business hotel than a tourist one.

The cooked breakfast was ok but the continental buffet was poor - limited choice and it all looked like it had been sitting out for a long time.

Overall, its a good day out. Exhibits are interesting and housed in an old POW camp. Lots of information and visuals although some of the huts are quite dark and scary for younger children (warnings on the huts which my cause distress though). Exhibits cover primarily the two world wars, although there are areas dedicated to later conflicts up to and including the present day. There is also an outdoor play area, shop and cafe and several areas (both indoor and outdoor) for picnics.  To see everything, I would say you need to allow about 4 hours, perhaps a little more. As the website points out, the huts are not heated so outdoor clothing is a good idea especially in the colder weather. Site appears fully accessible for all and is flat with well maintained paths throughout.  My only gripe is that they don&acute;t accept debit or credit cards.

I had a room looking out on the side of the building so I could see partly the river, partly some older buildings and mountains, and partly an office building next door. If you really want a lovely view, make sure you get the full-on river view or you can also see that from the dining room. As others have said, this hotel is a significant walk from the old town and the other options are to take a boat down the river, which I imagine can be a nice experience in good weather, or some other transportation. During my stay the weather was not good and I was busy with my meeting agenda so i preferred the peace and quiet of this hotel as it is removed from some (not all) of the city noise.  My room was quiet, well-appointed, everything clean, modern and in good working order. Excellent water pressure in shower. Large bed that I found very comfortable. In-room coffee was much appreciated. The desk staff were friendly, nice and very helpful in getting a document printed out for me quickly and at no charge when I needed it in a hurry for a meeting.  Breakfast was included with the room and had a reasonable variety of hot and cold dishes, bread/ pastry, fruit etc. I did notice that the breakfast was definitely better and fresher the earlier you came down to eat - if you got there later into the breakfast time, items ran out or tasted like they had been sitting out a while. They had a chef cooking omelets on one weekday but on other days there was no one manning the chef stations and it seemed difficult to tell on what days the omelets might reappear. There is also good coffee and tea available for free in the reception area all day.  My only complaint is that there was an extra charge for Internet. Since we like most business people on travel use the Internet constantly, it really should have been included in our rate as part of the business package. To be honest, I would rather have Internet included rather than breakfast included, as I normally don&acute;t eat a huge breakfast especially when rushing to get to a meeting, and we had additional food service at our meetings. I also noticed the driveways to this hotel are a bit wonky and the entrance/ exit area is small - not a problem for us as we were using buses and taxis but if you plan on driving here be aware that it may be a little tricky depending on what other vehicles are using the drive area.",4,1,101,Heidelberg Marriott Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187286-d239052-Reviews-Heidelberg_Marriott_Hotel-Heidelberg_Baden_Wurttemberg.html,Heidelberg,6

I have stayed in several of the hotels in the CBD and Canal St. areas. The location of this hotel is the perfect compromise. You have a reasonably short, safe walk to the Quarter, close to the lower CBD, Convention Center, Warehouse District, Casino, Aquarium and even the ferry to Algiers Point. Since the hotel is almost on the river, many of the rooms have a river view.  I arrived at the beginning of a holiday weekend and the front desk was mobbed with people checking in. The front desk was well staffed, efficient and processed the people fairly quickly. I am a HHonors gold member, so for my breakfast option was given access to the Executive Lounge. The lounge is on the top floor and has great views, but the breakfast offering was strictly continental with breads, cereal and fruit (no meat or other protein). The Lounge offered snacks in the evening along with a cash bar. In all, the lounge was a great setting with a not-so-lavish spread.  My room (a king) was spacious and well appointed, but showed a little bit of (repaired) wear. The A/C could just barely keep up with the 90+ degree heat. The large flat-screen TV had a decent selection of basic cable channels and several were in hi-def. The wireless internet had decent speed, but I was there during non-business times.

We were visiting family in Lincoln and wanted a value for money stay. The Holiday Inn Express certainly provided this. On arrival we were warmly greeted and given all the information we needed. The room had everything we needed for our short stay.  The included breakfast makes the room rate very good value. We were staying bank holiday weekend so the hotel was busy. There was plenty of breakfast and all the staff were working very hard to keep up with clearing tables and refreshing supplies.  The hotel&acute;s location is also very good being an easy walk to all the amenities on Brayford waterside and the main shopping areas.

I was surprised to find most of the neighborhood hotels filled and the ones with rooms charging exorbitant rates. So while this hotel set a record for me for a Holiday Inn at more than $300/night after taxes, it was the least expensive place I could find within the area. The location of the hotel is pretty good-around 6 blocks from the Dupont Circle Metro. This was a pleasant walk on a warm evening through a nice commercial area. It might be more difficult on a rainy or snowy evening. The welcome was very warm and friendly-clearly the front desk staff were well trained. The room was a but faded but clean. i was on the first floor so there was some traffic noise, but I was able to drown it out with the room AC which operated well. The room was without some of the amenities found in higher end hotels such as a sink outside of the bathroom, but had all of the essentials. I received free Internet access which worked well.

Nice to have a kettle in the room for tea and coffee, there&acute;s also a mini bar. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is well fitted out.

The hotel has gotten mixed reviews so I will put in my 2 cents. I know it&acute;s old but it is well maintained, nice and has a lot of character. I found the staff to be universally helpful and friendly, everyone from the desk clerks to the restaurant staff to the bellman to the cleaning lady- who came running downstairs while I was still checking out to look for me an give me something I had inadvertently left in the room. I would happily stay there again.  Two issues that need to be resolved: 1> The key cards only work once or maybe twice and then you have to take them to the front desk to get re-set. This was extremely annoying. I was there with a group and we ended up going to the front desk every time we entered the hotel. On top of that, at times the card would work in the elevator but not at your room door, or would open your room door but not the gym. It&acute;s a problem they need to address. 2> This is really the first hotel of this caliber I have seen in which there is NO WATER and NO TOWELS in the gym. Please?  Again- good hotel, I liked it.

Our room was on the top floor and although small (as are most rooms in Parisian hotels I believe) it was comfortable and clean. Again it was always cosy in the cold weather but also had windows which you could open if necessary.  We didn&acute;t bother with breakfast in the hotel as it wasn&acute;t included and there are plenty of options near to the hotel.  The staff were professional and helpful.  For us, the location made this hotel perfect and we would stay there again.  A few tips for nearby:- Le Petit Journal St Michel - jazz club.

My room was clean and overlooking the river with a great view of the downtown skyline. Best parts of the room were the comfortable bed, view and roomy bathroom with a huge lighted mirror. Only quirks I felt detracted slightly from the experience was a odd rumbling sound that I believe was due to the elevator bank (mine was the second room to the right of them) and a some signs of age with the furniture like scratches and gouges and a oddly mismatched looking hallway carpet.

We however got a great deal by booking through the Accor website four months in advance. Breakfast is better than most Ibis, this one actually had a Continental buffet.  The rooms are standard Ibis, however we were given the corner room that had handicapped bathroom. So we had massive amounts of space to put the baby cot however to shower her, it was quite the bother. I ended up having to shower with her rather than get thoroughly wet. This is because there are no baths at all in this Ibis. The train station one has a few bath tubs.  This corner room was very big, lots of space for our belongings, the baby bed was surprisingly soft for a folding travel bed and the sheets provided were fitted. Our bed was a firm double bed (not queen) and the AC was quite reactive enabling us to stabilize the temperature easily.  We found the rooms to be clean, and cleaning service was excellent thanks to a little euro coin we had the foresight to leave on the table. Small gestures can pay.

I chose le Pain Quotidien for a couple of reasons, one it has big windows and was running a brisk trade and secondly the people inside looked happy and so did the people coming out! How people carry themselves in a place actually says something.... the second reason I selected the place is because it isn&acute;t necessarily the obvious choice for all the tourists that descend on this part of the City - so sometimes you just want something that is not terribly touristey, or at least so I thought.  Table service is provided and you are asked to wait to be seated. Inside is airey and clean as you would expect. Though quarters are a little cramped, it was suggested I sit in the back which actually worked out fine, a large bench against big sash windows and the signature distressed wood tables.  I was presented with three menus, one for brunch specials, the normal menu and a menu that I recall carries liquor or at least wine at the very least. An odd option at this time of the day, but then it is always 5 o&acute;clock somewhere I guess.  The brunches were a little steeply priced and to be frank, nothing really caught my eye. I opted instead for a combination of dessert and breakfast by going for the scrambled eggs with mushrooms and the Belgian waffle.  The eggs and mushrooms came with a toast and a small salad, all very tasty on a large china plate. The toast was a diagonally cut slice from a bloomer loaf and was only supplied with one pat of butter which seemed to be on ration though i daresay if I asked for another I could have had one more.  The Waffle was on the surprisingly small size but very dense and in the end I felt it was sized about right - decorated with a couple of blueberries, strawberries and blackberries.  Try the conserves with the toast they&acute;re great, you have marmalade, strawberry jam and hazel spread to choose from - the hazel spread is sweet but a little of an acquired taste.  As beverages I ordered a macchiato which was disappointing as it turned out more like a double espresso and came with no milk at all but the latte was very good.  Both came in bowls which is the signature for this establishment, the macchiato in a smaller bowl.  If you&acute;re looking for good fare at a moderate price in a predictable chain store then like others in the chain you will not be disappointed here.

We were in the east wing and had a partial view of Old Faithful. It was really amazing to wake up in the morning and see Old Faithful go off while in your pjs! The room was comfortable. We did not get housekeeping service the first day until my mom called the front desk late in the afternoon. A young man named Zach was sent to clean the room. He was very personable and very nicely acted like he did this all the time and it was not a problem for him. The second day, my mom found the housekeeping staff on our floor and asked them to specifically clean our room which they did. My other family members had the same type of housekeeping issues during our stay. We knew it was late in the season and that the hotel was short staffed but cleaning the rooms seems like a no brainer. Because we were traveling in a large family group, we had had some issues with our reservations when we checked in. The front desk clerk was not rude but she was not helpful either. None of us liked her or felt like she was listening to us. When I talked to Tom at the front desk the second day, he was very nice and helpful while still presenting a very business-like front. We ate in the dining room one night and got food to go one night from the Lodge cafeteria.",4,1,100,Old Faithful Inn,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60999-d220121-Reviews-Old_Faithful_Inn-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,Yellowstone National Park,6

4275,ASWh,Hotels,8/26/2015,Another good stay at the Palace,"We visited Como again this summer and despite having looked at other hotel options around Como, we thought the Palace was the best bet. We would definitely recommend staying in a lake view room (or higher category) as you get the renovated block which is better. Views across the lake are lovely and the window (full length) opens right out so you get lots of fresh air.  Excellent buffet breakfast included in the price. Very comfortable rooms and well appointed, although not sure how well the air conditioning worked in our room. Quite quiet despite being on the road. Great location as lots of restaurant choices within a 5 minute walk in either direction (to the funicular or the town centre).  Would definitely stay again but worth spending the money on a higher room rate to get more space. Slightly annoying that the wifi code is only valid for 24 hours as we kept forgetting to pick up a new one. Maybe they could look at extending that to cover your whole stay which would make more sense.  Would also like them to open the bar in the evenings - the Garden Bar is good and the staff great but the live music wasn&acute;t the best we&acute;ve seen (!). You can take drinks back to your room though.",4,0,100,Palace Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187835-d277060-Reviews-Palace_Hotel-Como_Lake_Como_Lombardy.html,Como,6
4301,ASWh,Hotels,9/1/2014,Lovely location in Como,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Palace Hotel in Como and, from a walk around the town, think we made the best choice. It is worth paying the extra for a junior suite as it looks exactly as on the website (for a change!) and is beautifully equipped and comfortable. Also very quiet, even with the balcony door open, which was a pleasant change for us after being on a busy road in Lugano. The bathroom is heavenly with a large bath and separate shower with &acute;his & hers&acute; sinks and nice toiletries. All very modern and obviously recently refurbished.  Breakfast is plentiful and well stocked/maintained (the best of our trip). The staff were (mostly) helpful and efficient. We had an issue with the wifi being overcharged on our bill - we were told the first day was included as part of our suite rate which was nice, but then it appeared three times on our bill! Eventually this came off but there was a little reluctance which made us feel a little cheap... As with other reviewers, this was the only place we stayed where there was a charge for the wifi, and only one device can be used at a time which meant logging on and off to check emails/internet, etc. A little inconvenient, especially because you are being charged for it.  I would be happy to recommend this hotel as this is truly a four star hotel but it does feel that they only have part of the building advertised as the Palace as you walk through the impressive gates. There is a small bar in the wing where the breakfast room is and the main bar area is the Garden Bar on the roadside. A very nice place and again the staff were great, but the disappointment for us was that it wasn&acute;t open on Monday. It was very quiet generally in the town on the Monday with a lot of restaurants closed which did make for a &acute;small town&acute; feel.

The upgrade added floor to ceiling windows and a king size bed. The rooms were located next to each other on the 23rd floor, however one room was large with a sitting area and the other was about 75% of the size and fairly compact. Parking is expensive at the hotel (about average with other hotels in the area) and the amenities in the room are fairly limited compared to other Starwood hotels I&acute;ve stayed at. The room did include a personal coffee maker with Starbuck&acute;s coffee, which was an excellent touch and much easier to use then your average hotel coffee maker.

As a chain I rather like Park Plaza hotels and this experience served to confirm that opinion. Large, clean, modern rooms, helpful staff and good in-room facilities. We paid for breakfast at reception but at the restaurant found that it was a tad disorganised - we just walked in and served ourselves and it would have been easy to have avoided paying at all (however, it was a weekend and very busy). Food choice was varied and things like lovely Glamorgan sausages and having actual &acute;crispy&acute; bacon (rather than that almost boiled looking stuff you often get) was appreciated.  Check in and check out were simple and quick and overall the hotel was good value for London.

15723,Botticelligirl,Hotels,3/9/2011,Very comfortable hotel though a little out of the way,"I stayed at the Radisson only one night, on business. I took the DLR as it looked simple on the map, but it was a bit of a trek вЂ“ luckily I did not have luggage. But the room did make up for the location: it was spacious, with nice modern dГ©cor, very comfortable and with everything you need on a business trip including a proper hairdryer, iron and ironing board housed in a little flat wardrobe of their own. The bathroom was large and attractive, with a bath as well as a rain shower; though I did miss a bathrobe and slippers. Toiletries provided in pump bottles fixed to the wall, rather than the usual mini bottles, but including body lotion (bonus points). The large flat-screen TV and Ipod docking station also pleasing, and there is complimentary secure wi-fi in the rooms. (At this level it should be a given, but it isnвЂ™t). There was absolutely no view from my room, but I only stayed one night so I did not mind.  The one thing that I found irritating was that the temperature control did not work properly: the thermostat in the room kept re-setting itself though I kept turning it down, and as a result the room was too hot to sleep in with the warm duvet. I did not feel like querying it with hotel staff as it was late in the evening, and as I couldnвЂ™t sleep I ended up in desperation opening the window. At which point there was street noiseвЂ¦ But managed to block it out in the end. IвЂ™d advise to check that the air con works if you are at all sensitive to that. Other than this, the sound insulation seemed very effective and the beds were very comfy. But why oh why do hotels always provide massive pillows?  Now the location is a little unfortunate in my opinion. It is out of the way, not in a pleasant area to wander around in the evening, and although the DLR transport to Canary Wharf or Westferry looks simple on the map, in reality it is a bit of a walk away. They do have a shuttle service to Canary Wharf but only every 20 minutes or so.  I did not have breakfast in the morning, but I would expect it to be excellent given the overall standard of this hotel. I also did not try the spa or any of the other amenities. The service was courteous enough. Of the hotels in this area вЂ“ i.e. away from Canary Wharf вЂ“ I would probably choose this one.",4,1,101,Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d651411-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Edwardian_New_Providence_Wharf_Hotel-London_England.html,London,6

The staff remembered me from my previous stays so that is always appreciated.  I may sound a bit spoiled but I must say I was a bit surprised when I walked in the room and did not have an amenity like the previous times.

When I arrived, I checked in immeditely. the front desk agent was nice and friendly but when i asked a few questions about the surrounding area, she was not aware of what i was referring to (I visit NYC quite often and for being an out of towner, I feel I know the city well). I then went up to the second floor and spoke with the concierge for a few minutes. She was helpful, friendly and knowledgable.  My room was on the 9th floor, tucked away in the corner of the hall. I was ok with the location, as it was far away from the elevator and not necessarily in a busy hallway. The actual room however, was super tiny! Dont get me wrong, I was not expecting a suite but just thought it was a bit too cozy for me. I had an amenity waiting in my room since I am an Elite Marriott member and thought it was such an important detail - didnt have to pay the $12 they charge for a large bottle of FIJI water!!  The furniture was damaged and not at its best condition. The bathroom was, to my surprise, very spacious (well appreciated) and the amenities were from Aveda, one of my favorite products!  The door holders and bellboys were great, I have several interactions with them and they were amazing. I even shared a cupcake (hard for me to do since that is probably the only thing in the world I am selfish about!!) with the bellhopper, Alex. He was very friendly and suggested one of his favorite sushi restaurant down the street from the hotel called Ginger.  I recently visited NYC in early March (stayed at a diff property) and came back on the last day of my trip to bring Alex a cupcake, to my very surprise, I was greeted by the same bell hops and they remembered me and wecomed me back!

It should be the industry norm by now to have free wi-fi, but Sheratons in particular seem to be very stingy in this regard. That&acute;s a real pity, because there are very few other faults with this place. Location is unbeatable, just a short walk to Disneyland and some fine restaurants like Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.

Rooms were very clean and tidy, with mini-fridge and very comforatble beds, and we had an 11th floor balcony with views over the theme park, which was truly amazing.

Check in was smooth: as a higher floor room wasn&acute;t available, we were moved to a lanai room overlooking the pool. Initially we were concerned that there may be some noise from the pool or the interconnecting door to the next room, but this was very minimal. Room was well appointed with a sofa and grandfather chair in addition to the bed. It was nice to have the balcony too even if the room only overlooked the pool and other rooms.  Breakfast was over-priced as it is in all of these sorts of hotels and the spread not as good as one would expect for the money being asked for it. It is possible to have a continental buffet ($14.50) breakfast for a smaller price than the full buffet but this isn&acute;t advertised on their menu. Service was friendly but variable and on one morning we had to ask three times for our toast before it arrived. The muffins, however, were delicious!  Reception staff were always very helpful and issues dealt with swiftly (eg a light bulb that needed replacing / our request to check out late). Parking is convenient in a garage right by the hotel and (unlike some places) you don&acute;t have to valet park. There is a charge for wifi but we were given this as complimentary - not too sure why but we weren&acute;t complaining!

There is a bowling alley and movie theater and other activities that I didn&acute;t even take advantage of, but will next year. I would probably only go to the strip if I had tickets to a show.  South Point is also close to lots of outlet shopping. Car rentals being reasonable, I would probably rent a car while there instead of using the shuttle so I could explore some of the area right around the hotel and head to the strip hotels via the highway if I wanted to go there.  The rooms were very nice - spacious, clean and comfortable. Everyone I encountered from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was very nice.  As we often don&acute;t get out a lot during the competition, it was an added benefit that South Point offered more and better restaurants.

Meals arrived in pretty short time and were of normal portion size with chips served up in small enamelware for the burger and steak. The poussin was served on a mound of couscous. Regrettably there was no garnish and had we known this we might have ordered a salad as an accompaniment. The meals were tasty nonetheless.  A variety of beers are available on tap as well as a wine list with some good variety.

Whilst the bar is sophisticated the dining room is less so and a bit somber and poorly lit. The service and food is very good. My partner had twice baked cheese soufflГ© to start and I had a classic prawn cocktail. For main course she had battered fish and chips and I had the fillet steak plus mushrooms. We washed this down with a bottle of Picpoul de Pinet and sparkling water. A nice un-expected touch was the birthday pannacotta with candle. Total including a tip was ВЈ118. Warning parking is non-existent and the dining room wall shelf, laden with sauces bottles for the Hotel breakfast, unless it was modern art just looked naff!

22629,ClintonJ1,Hotels,2/1/2015,Great proximity for the RG IT Park,"My first stay was primed with a warning from a colleague that the hotel is sprawling and a little lonely however given the really close proximity to the IT park the advantages of location over a social vibe make this a place to give good consideration to.  Over the years I watched the site develop and of course I was pleased when the property was eventually commissioned and opened to customers.  The rooms are very spacious and well appointed, cabled internet is of a good quality and there is a large flat screen TV. Although new, the sloppy implementation of the fittings and fixtures was sloppy and so it is easy to think the place is older than it really is. Annoying things like ill installed roller blinds and crooked light switches and inaccessible blind pulls were annoying.  My room had a hardwood floor and a massive picture window facing the front of the hotel. Tea and Coffee facilities in room are available and there is plenty of clothes hanging space. The in-room security safe was not bolted down which was an odd thing.  The bathroom comes with a nice shower with good water pressure and a robinet for the dual flush toilet. The mirror for the handbasin is heated to avoid steaming up and the towels are in good condition with a bath mat also provided. Toiletries are numerous which is great! Mouthwash would be a great addition but is not provided.  In hotel dining at present is available at the Cafe, the Bar or the main restaurant, the other two facilities were not open during my stay. A la Carte is available as well as a buffet. The buffet is weighted in favour of local cuisine but doesn&acute;t offer much variation from day to day. On two of the six days of our stay we ate a la carte and two days we ate out.  The hotel has a nice pool but not much of a pool side ambience perhaps because of the time of year.  The hotel does not appear to have a gym/fitness centre or at least none could be located. The mini mall is presently not operational so you would need to come with what you need or send out for requisites though the mall is a short walk up the road.  Airconditioning was not operating for the duration of the stay with my room unable to get below a balmy 24&acute;c indoors while outdoors the temperature ranged from 3&acute;c to 12&acute;c. I was told the room- a/c had been deliberately switched off for all rooms to regulate temperature - disappointing...  The staff were very enthusiastic and kind if a little experienced and this was demonstrated in some faux pas during the stay. Great opportunities for improvement.  My final comment is that you will likely have a great stay, if the hotel can improve on ambience and service standards this will always be a great place to stay if for no reason that it is newer and has a good locale for those visiting the IT park.",4,1,100,The Lalit Chandigarh,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297596-d4558938-Reviews-The_Lalit_Chandigarh-Chandigarh.html,Chandigarh,6

Based on the TA reviews I wasn&acute;t expecting that much but the hotel was fine. Arrived well before the official check-in time but the room was ready. The room&acute;s are not big but they are well decorated, comfortable and very clean. Everything looked brand new and was immaculate. The bathroom also was not huge but very shiny and new. The best thing was the gorgeous view over the Thames and Tower Bridge with the London Eye in the distance. The room has everything you would expect in a good hotel - branded cosmetics, bathrobes and slippers, cable TV, underfloor heating in the bathroom, etc. We were on the fifth floor, which has no ice machine. I went down a floor to get ice and it was like being transported back in time to the 1970&acute;s (The Shining springs to mind!) I guess some floors haven&acute;t been renovated recently so I would bear that it mind if you book to stay here. Lots of cafes and restaurants near by around a nice marina at the back of the hotel.

The room was on the 6th floor and had a great view of Tower Bridge and the Thames. It was not huge but it was comfortable and very clean. The breakfast was very good with plenty of choices to set you up for a days sightseeing. Outside the hotel were several kiosks selling various snacks and drinks.

Every entrance to the building is a big grey concrete slab - it felt like the Soviet Union or something!

31006,Ervaan,Hotels,1/21/2011,Good value for the price,"This is a nice hotel, there&acute;s some renovation going on, much needed because some areas of the lobby, store area and gym area look rather outdated. The prices are OK considering that good hotels in LA are very expensive. It took us a long time to decide where to stay in LA because it is such a gigantic city with so many nice areas to stay. but some of them are so expensive, we couldn&acute;t afford them like Santa Monica, Beverly Hills or Century City. Hotels in there cost +250$ a night, I mean, nice hotels of 4* or something. Staying at the Bonaventure in downtown LA was a great idea because downtown LA is very much in the center of the city and it took a quick drive (avoiding rush hours of course) to go to the beaches, to Century City, to Berverly Hills or even the airport.  More about the hotel, we had problems with the TV set, they had to come and reprogramme it so they gave us free access to the breakfast buffet the next day, without asking, so that was very nice. The next day we got to the room at 8 pm but it hadn&acute;t been cleaned yet! Amazing. The cleaning manager was not helpful at all, as a matter of fact he showed us a lot of attitude. So I went down to reception and complained and they gave us free drinks while we waited for the room to be cleaned. This was nice too. I really dont hold a grudge for this, because the fixed the problem inmediately.  The room was in the upper floor, like 23 or something, it had nice views and the room is very modern and clean. A bit small for US standards. Alll in all we had a great experience and would get back to this hotel if needed.  Parking issues, don&acute;t fight them. The best solution is the valet parking, it is 35$, yes 35$ but it is still cheaper than the nearby parkings downtown. So accept it or don&acute;t drive, which is kind of impossible in LA.",4,1,100,The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32655-d77874-Reviews-The_Westin_Bonaventure_Hotel_Suites-Los_Angeles_California.html,Los Angeles,6

The service is consistently excellent and the staff are very friendly and professional. If there is any issue, the management is very responsive. The rooms are varied and are clean and comfortable. The location can&acute;t be beat. What would make it even better in my view is faster internet and better access to the gym. There is no wireless in the rooms (only lobby area) and the in room wired services is very slow which is not good for a business traveler. Access to the fitness center is through a single lift that is also used by the bellmen to move bags and if it is not working, you can only access the gym when the spa is open and you have to walk outside to get there.",4,0,100,The Westin Paris - Vendome,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d587294-Reviews-The_Westin_Paris_Vendome-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,Paris,6

In the interest of full disclosure, I stay at the Westin Paris quite often, but there is a reason, the staff and level of service, and Starwood points. I often find myself on the 5th floor in a section that is serviced by a member of the staff named Vida. I speak little French, she speaks a little English, but every time I run into her she greats me with an enthusiastic hello. When I was there over the Christmas holidays, she gave me a hand made crochet runner that was the most prized possesion under my tree. Whatever reviewers say about the size of the rooms, take it with a grain of salt, as in the fashion of a hotel in an historical property, the rooms are not cookie cutter, and many have little balconies with great views. I am a runner and love the location for great morning runs, in the last year, they added a new fitness room in the basement. By US standards, the equipment is good but a bit cramped and the ventilation could be improved , but by European standards, it is pretty good. The most recent addition is the Six Senses Spa, also on the lower level. I had a Thai massage there and for athletes, it is an incredible massage, so try it out.

Yes there was some noise from outside and some rumbling from tube trains but you can find this in many establishments in London.

The food was good and the price reasonable.  It is good to see this independent restaurant survive with all the surrounding competition from the chain restaurants.  There was one small negative and perhaps we noticed this more because it was a bright and warm summer evening. The fabric of the property could do with a refurb.

4326,ASWh,Restaurants,5/9/2012,Another visit to the Vin & Maree - perfect service this time!,"I brought my parents to the Vin & Maree in avenue Suffren as I knew we would have a full description of the specials board in english but had flagged with them that it might take a while as the service tailed off last time. I booked a table in advance for 7.30pm and we were the first in the restaurant (so my Dad was very amused that I&acute;d booked...). However, it was full and there were people waiting by the time we came out (it was a Thursday) so worth the booking (and to prove the point to my Dad!).  I think our waiter was called Patrick - he spoke very good English and was very patient at going through the menu, talking about each of the specials and answering questions. We had the shared seafood platter for three which was delicious. My parents then shared the John Dory and it was a large fish and shown to us when cooked and then filleted for them. They both enjoyed it enormously. I had the scallops which are always a favourite and these were delicious.  My problem with the restaurant last time was that they lost interest in us after the main course was served. Am pleased to say that wasn&acute;t our experience this time, we had our wine topped up regularly, were asked if we wanted dessert (no room sadly...) and then he even ordered a taxi for us at the end of the meal.  All in all, a delicious meal again and the service was not only better than last time but properly memorable! Am really pleased we came back and will definitely keep on my list for the future.

The head waiter was charming, accommodating and explained everything on the menu in English. The food came quickly and was delicious. We were offered a glass of wine and given the option to change if we didn&acute;t like it. The main course then also came quickly after which things started to go wrong. Nothing wrong with the food, we both enjoyed the flavours and thought both starter & main courses were excellent and good for the money (slightly pricey but nice ambiance). However, we were pretty much ignored after the main course was put in front of us - we had to signal to the waitress to get another glass of wine, the water wasn&acute;t replenished and we asked three times for the bill. We ended up waiting 40 mins to get the bill, this despite them putting people both sides of us and taking their orders. It put a dampener on what should have been a great evening as we felt very ignored after receiving our food. I admit it&acute;s worse to wait a very long time for food but we weren&acute;t offered another drink while we were waiting or any apology. I think they might have been a little short staffed but seemed to have their priorities wrong in resetting tables rather than handing out the bill!

470,19katy80,Hotels,1/16/2011,Good for the price,"We booked this as a cheap late deal holiday and weren&acute;t really expecting that much for the price - just wanted a week on a nice beach. The beach was, for me, the best bit about the hotel. Some reviews said the beach isn&acute;t that nice, which I don&acute;t understand. The sand is powder soft, the sea is perfect for swimming and getting a sunlounger was never a problem when we were there. The watersports guys are nice and will give you snorkel gear, kayaks, etc and there&acute;s a guy who will take you out on a hobie cat if you want. The snorkelling just off the beach is ok, not spectacular but there&acute;s fish and I saw 2 turtles just of the hotel - one adult and a baby! The free catamaran trip/swimming with turtles is also great - Charlie is a great guide! Back to the hotel - we had a spa room. We were given one on the ground floor. These rooms aren&acute;t especially private as the windows are very close to the pool. Also our shower wasn&acute;t fitted properly, coming away from the wall and hardly any water coming out of it. We asked to move to an upstairs room, and that room was better. Although shower still not great. Having seen the beach, I wished we&acute;d booked a sea view room. It&acute;s worth the extra. Food in the restaurants was good quality. The breakfast was especially good. There&acute;s no vegetarian choice. If you are vegetarian I would not recommend this hotel but if you eat meat, or especially fish, the food is fine. For both food and service, the best restaurant was the Bajan restaurant in the spa section of the hotel. The hotel is a bit in the middle of nowhere. I know it&acute;s all inclusive so guests don&acute;t really need to leave, but it&acute;s quite a small hotel and towards the end of the week we were feeling a little bit penned in so we went out and found a really nice little beach bar/Italian restaurant about 5 minutes down the road. Can&acute;t remember the name, but it is the only one around - its just past the supermarket on the other side of the road. We went in early December and had no problems with insects. Didn&acute;t even see a mosquito the entire week! The pool at the spa was lovely, very cold and again we didn&acute;t have a problem getting a lounger. The service at Waves was fine. Its not a 5 star hotel so we didn&acute;t expect 5 star service. The meeting with the virgin rep (who is based at Waves) was just a sales pitch - don&acute;t bother going, she doesn&acute;t give any useful info that you don&acute;t already have. And the check in chill out service was a shambles, as the rep hadn&acute;t passed on the right info to the check in staff so they didn&acute;t have the right boarding passes! All in all, we had a good week here and think for the money paid (under ВЈ900 for a week all in) it&acute;s excellent value. However, if we go back to Barbados I would stay somewhere else - in a town with a bit of life!",4,3,103,Waves,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147265-d260445-Reviews-Waves-Saint_James_Parish_Barbados.html,Saint James Parish,6
13973,Bingley1,Hotels,12/16/2012,Perfect for relaxation...... something missing though.,"Just returned from a trip to Waves in St James and our overall holiday experience was mixed. I travelled with my wife and stayed in the Ocean Front apartment. The positive points in our opinion are as follows 1) Rooms are very spacious, tastefully decorated and quite modern with decent sized balcony and dressing room. 2) Two free spa treatments and catamaran trip (if travelling with Virgin) must be taken up. Completely relaxing and staff couldn&acute;t have been more friendly. 3) Staff on reception very helpful and friendly. 4) Direct access onto the beach from the hotel if staying ocean front. 5) Within 10 minutes bus ride to Holetown or 15 minutes to Bridgetown with bus stops a 2 minute walk away. 6) Housekeeping was very good.  The negative points. 1) Some of the staff although friendly never seemed to smile. A smile goes a long way and doesn&acute;t cost a lot. 2) Although close to a major town and city we missed being able to go for a walk because it is quite isolated and with the hotel being on the busy main highway you take your life in your hands when you walk on the road because the pavements are hit and miss. 3) Although the restaurant boasts 3 restaurants (al a carte, oriental and italian) be prepared for Bajan versions of all three. We found the food to be hit and miss. Maybe the hotel could change the menu once a week because we struggled over 11 nights. Two of the 3 restaurants are open at any one time so you have to book your table. 4) The entertainment was average at best and finished at 10.30pm. We aren&acute;t party animals by a long way but most nights it was almost as if we were listening to background music. Apart from two acts the rest seemed to be playing to themselves and didn&acute;t really engage the audience who often drifted off before the end and with no bars close by the evenings seemed to drag. 5) Choice of drinks was very poor. The local drinks were ok but if you wanted branded drinks you had to pay which is fair enough but the choice was non existant. 6) If staying on the Spa side of the hotel in the gardens be aware that you have to cross the main road (busy most times of the day). There is a large pool there and the oriental restaurant but I&acute;m not sure if the bar is open during the day (except lunch and dinner times) so you may have to go to the main part of the hotel for refreshments. 7) Two weddings took place whilst we were there and if your considering this hotel as a venue think again. I&acute;m sure the hotel organised things very well but the two locations we saw being used were terrible. One couple were married at one end of the varander which happened to be next to towel exhange area and large wooden fence down one side. The other couple chose the beach. Because of the time the wedding took place the tide was beginning to come in and the bride had to time her run to the altar in between the waves. The altar was placed at the top end of the beach next to some tall metal fences ! I would have been gutted if it was me.  Overall I would recommend this hotel if you want total relaxation. It is isolated in terms of wanting to go for a walk but public transport is there. Sort the entertainment out and we would have been happier. For us we enjoyed our time there although quite a few people we spoke to had numerous issues and weren&acute;t happy. They seemed to be the ones staying in the garden area. If your looking for a lively hotel then look again. Finally put information in reception about things to see and do in Barbados. You shouldn&acute;t have to book everything through Virgin !",4,2,102,Waves,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147265-d260445-Reviews-Waves-Saint_James_Parish_Barbados.html,Saint James Parish,6

Whole Foods and Starbucks less than a block away, so stocking the kitchenette was a breeze. SoBe circular stop in front of hotel and runs about every 20 mins. Opting for a cab ride to Lincoln Rd will run you about $6. Important to note that if you book through an online deal/resort promotion, you are not considered a guest of the Mondrian. The resort company owns units within the building and rents them out, so traditional Mondrian services (complimentary Wifi, daily room service, etc) are not available to you. That said, room was exactly the same as the traditional Mondrian unit, towel service was provided daily and required service to my room telephone was handled promptly and professionally.

Expect about a 20 minute walk to Lincoln Road and/or Collins. Room has an efficiency/small condo feel. Studio layout w/separate bath and kitchenette. Desk staff, conceirge, spa, and pool attendants were all great. Pool waitresses could offer better service.

Nothing really stood out as spectacular. Probably the tastiest most interesting dishes are the asparagus zucchini artichoke pistachio dip and the truffle polenta. Two of the dishes had the same garnish which was a bit tired. The blue cheese fig and rocket salad and dressing was quite nice. The huge fat potato wedges didn&acute;t do anything for me.

The lamb entre was so over priced and nothing special. 4 small chewy lamb bits. However the truffled polenta was excellent. The zucchini, asparagus, artichoke and pistachio entre is brilliant. Only suggestion is to improve the quality of the artichokes or remove the outer sections. The rose on tap was awful. Sour. The mini deserts are brilliant.

She just told us to make the payment at the hotel itself. When we reached the hotel, the check in was smooth and immediately we were offered lovely tea by one of the staff in our room (on the house). We had booked a Golden Fish room. The room was done in wood, and had a small balcony offering a stunning view. Even the windows were huge. The room was very clean and aesthetically decorated. The bed was king size and very comfortable. We really loved the food. One word about food at their restaurant. The food is like home cooked food and its best to stick to known choices. Breakfast was ok, having limited choices. However, the personal attention and hospitality won us over. The place is run efficiently by a Tibetan lady. Views from the room were awesome and it was nice waking up to the views of the mountains and the sunlight streaming into your room. Its a 10 minute uphill walk to the hotel from the Mcleodganj Chowk and the hotel is situated on Jogiwara Road. At night, the place becomes very quiet and it feels a bit unsafe.

I have never had broccoli/vegetables mixed into an Alfredo before, but it worked, and certainly made the meal less heavy. The grilled chicken was tender and juicy--definitely not dried out the way grilled chicken often is. The Alfredo sauce was not remarkable, but perfectly acceptable.

The front desk staff were very efficient (the cookies given at check-in were quite tasty) and the room was comfortable and clean. The walls were a bit thin (I could hear a guest in the room next door coughing, but it wasn&acute;t enough to bother me--especially for the excellent room-rate.

The parking is sufficient with some on-street parking available. My husband and I often travel with a small cargo trailer, and although it wasn&acute;t with me on this trip, there would have been room for us to park on the side street just next to the parking lot.

Although the neighborhood around it might seem intimidating to those not familiar with NYC, it is really a convenient location (basically steps from Chinatown) and subway stop (Canal Street) is a block or so away. The only consideration that may negatively impact some visitors is that most of the restaurants in the immediate area around the hotel are Chinese, so if you don&acute;t care for that cuisine you might have to venture further to find a restaurant.

The limousine service from and to the airports Narita and Haneda stop at the Metropolitan (ВҐ3100 single ride from/to NRT, almost every hour, takes 2 hours).

There is a small kitchen eating area right behind the front desk, and a coffee and tea area. It isn&acute;t well signed to tell you what you have to pay for and what is complimentary. There no bathtubs in the rooms, although a nice sized shower. They have put in programable thermostats in these rooms , and I really don&acute;t know why hotels do this, as they can be confusing and it can take time to figure out if it is set wrong ..meantime you are cold or hot...better to be able to just set the temp for what you want.

There was still plenty of room to walk around. Also had a closet which could easily store larger pieces of luggage for those staying longer. The bathroom was updated with plenty of towels and toiletries and was very roomy. The biggest downside is that the hotel faces the Ground Zero construction site, so rooms facing that direction will have construction noise 24 hours per day. I am not a light sleeper so it did not bother me. Others may want to bring earplugs if they are sensitive to noise - but heck, NYC tends to be noisy anyway, so bring them no matter where you stay! The staff were pleasant and efficient - no complaints there. The location is OK but not my first choice. Close to a couple of subway stops but there really is a lack of decent restaurant choices within walking distance. Didn&acute;t use any of the hotel facilities other than the free continental breakfast we were offered. It was fine but nothing to write home about.

Good cups of cappuccino and espresso are also available as are wonderful Italian pastries. Small cups of gelato run about $2.95 but are well worth it. And you can mix/match flavors in your cup, so don&acute;t stick with just one. (A combination of chocolate and coffee gelatos is just delectable.) If eating out in Annapolis, don&acute;t order dessert at a restaurant - take a stroll over to Aromi d&acute;Italia and get a gelato or pastry! Supposedly, they supply gelato to the Italian Embassy in D.C., and after trying them out, I can understand why.",4,1,101,Starbucks,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41081-d4262697-Reviews-Starbucks-Columbia_Maryland.html,Columbia,8

Very friendly and professional staff, spacious rooms and a good breakfast is served. The view from my room on the 11th floor was great. The tv in the rooms have many channels from many countries. However bear in mind that the breakfast room can get very crowded (especially on weekend mornings after 9.00) so consider taking items to your room. Also bear in mind that rooms are not serviced during weekends unless you request it 24 hours in advance. Altough the hotel is not in central London the location is perfect.

11862,Bangkokexpat,Hotels,7/5/2007,Competent. Comfortable. Great Location.,"I stayed at Swissotel The Stamford for four nights during the end of June, 2007. This four star hotel lived up to my expectations. It was competent, comfortable, polite, clean and well-appointed. My room on the 26th floor, was large, modern and pleasant, with all the amenities one would expect. The large bathroom sparkled. The dГ©cor, while standard issue, was pleasant. While I had no complaints, and was generally satisfied, the hotel has no particular distinction or character, which is admittedly difficult to achieve in a downtown 70-story high rise.  The breakfast was as varied, ample, and delicious as I&acute;ve had anywhere, and the large, striking, three-story atrium breakfast room, made up in theatre what it lacked in intimacy. Unlike many of its four star brethren, the friendly staff did an excellent job of continuously cleaning my table of plates and keeping my tea topped up. Breakfast was served until 11:00 AM, which was terrific for my schedule.  The major advantage of this hotel is its location. The hotel is attached to the Raffles City shopping mall, which itself is attached to the City Hall MRT station. Through numerous underground air conditioned tunnels, themselves constituting shopping malls, you can walk to The Esplanade, and to numerous shopping malls and a convention center. It is an easy and cheap (about US$1) MRT ride from Changi Airport to the hotel, which is about as convenient as you can get.  In the past, I stayed at the more expensive Raffles The Plaza, which is next door to Swissotel The Stamford, and is also attached to the same mall. I could find no differences in the two hotels which would justify a higher price for Raffles The Plaza.  Bottom line: I&acute;ll stay at Swissotel The Stamford again.",4,7,107,Swissotel The Stamford,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294265-d301573-Reviews-Swissotel_The_Stamford-Singapore.html,Singapore,8

Comfortable bed, great pillows, great room, friendly staff. A couple of things I would suggest to the mgt - The bell staff sometimes &acute;disappear&acute;&acute; - staff needs to coordinate together to be visibly available.

16579,BronwenL,Hotels,11/23/2009,Wonderful beds!,"This is the second time we&acute;ve stayed at the Bonaventure when doing business in LA. As with the first time, we were very happy with the experience. The check in was easy and the girls at the counter had a sense of humor. We checked in very late but they were still chipper. We asked for a King room but when we got to our room it had 2 beds. Turns out there was a computer glitch but we were promptly moved to another room with the king per our request.  Every room in the hotel has a city view and they are all oddly shaped rooms. If you&acute;re expecting a massive suite you&acute;ll be disappointed, but the small modern rooms are well appointed and very clean. The reason we came back to the Bonaventure is because they have the absolute BEST beds. The bed was so comfortable it was like sleeping on a cloud. Bring your own pillows though, theirs offer no support. Even though there were many teens in the building one night for their prom, we couldn&acute;t hear any noise from the streets or other rooms. We found it very peaceful and relaxing. We were able to get a late check out with no fuss and at no extra charge. For an upscale LA hotel, the rates here are very good.  We were working late while we were in town so we ordered 1am room service for dinner one night. The food is very expensive but was delivered quickly by a very pleasant server. Everything tasted good although probably not really worth $18 for a quesadilla. There&acute;s an IHOP 3 blocks away if you&acute;re in need of late-night sustenance. The breakfast buffet is also pricey but excellent. Be prepared for the valet parking (their service is outstanding and we felt very safe leaving expensive art in the vehicle overnight). The cost to hotel guests for overnight parking with in-out privileges is $24 (ouch). For guests it&acute;s $34 but they can get validation at the lobby bar for 3 hours for $7. There is also a large parking structure across the street at Flower and 4th which is probably cheaper.  When we&acute;re in town again on business, the Bonaventure will be the first hotel we consider.",4,0,100,The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32655-d77874-Reviews-The_Westin_Bonaventure_Hotel_Suites-Los_Angeles_California.html,Los Angeles,8

Motel is a comfortable and overall good value for it&acute;s two stars.  Basic room which had two double beds, good Sat TV, microwave and fridge. Tea & coffee available in the room and at reception. Toaster would have been a good touch. Was pleased the room had a bath and shower though, not s good for making toast...  Rooms in need of bit of updating and some TLC but functional and worth the money. Motel is directly opposite part of the airport run-way but noise was not an issue at all.  Heating is blow air type which is typical in US motels. Warms up quickly but can be noisy. Air wasn&acute;t really tested due to outside temps.  Free room safe and free Internet (fairly fast and reliable). Free parking directly outside your door. The &acute;pool&acute; is more of a oversize outdoor bath.  On first impression some of the reception staff do seem a bit preoccupied and distant but that&acute;s not important to me and after a while they were friendly enough. they helpful enough to advise me not to put &acute;indecental&acute; charges of debit card as is charged straigtaway, rather to use cedit card.  useful &acute;Bear-bites&acute; breakfast consist of cakes,Bagels, cereal and coffee/tea.  I had read some of the reviews which said about security in the area etc. One day I accidentally left my safe door wide open while out for the day and with my money, passport etc in it. despite the room having been cleaned I returned to find all my possessions were in the room.

The tile is old and worn. The caulking around the old tub needs to be redone. The fixtures are old and worn and kinda dirty. This is really the only bad comment I have. We had a standard room.

20410,ChampagneDoberman,Hotels,12/8/2010,We would return here for another great time in Florida,"We stayed here for 7 nights in late November arriving at Orlando airport and travelling by hire car at nightfall to our destination. (NOTE..! We found the Vista Cay resort difficult to find owing to lack of 1/signs 2/ lighting around the signs and 3/Lack of information on where office was located. We believe some people may struggle to find the resort and also to locate the office to obtain check-in codes to accomodation. We are quite well-seasoned and independant travellers but still had problems entering the complex). As stated on other reviews head straight to the check-in office which is located on the left (as driving from the airport) along the road from the Vista Cay resort on the same side next to the large &acute;Publix&acute; foodstore. This is the Millenium Vista Cay office. We got our key-code entry for both the gates to the resort and our apartment and were offered an up-grade to a Millenium three bed executive apartment at no extra cost. This was on the 4th floor of building 5012 (number 404). I did read on other reviews about a compromise of adequate security at this resort so we sensibly kept our door double locked. This was a very spacious apartment and was equipped with everything we required including towels, very handy washing machine(enough washing powder for 1 wash), dryer and iron/ironing board, huge fridge/freezer/ ice machine, 2 bathrooms/showers, nice balcony looking over the pool area with recliner and chairs. We did&acute;nt use half the space of this accomodation! The Publix store down the road was convenient for groceries and the NYPD pizza place next door was very good and would recommend. We used them for a delivery. The Vista Cay resort was quiet and civilized, very well kept and attractive. The gym near to the pool was well equipped and kept very clean, the best time to attend probably being early morning. We did not use the club house but this seemed always busy with children occupied by playing air-hockey and other games. There is no on-site shop or bar selling refreshments but we used &acute;Wallgreens&acute; which sells most essentials and is located just on the corner outside the complex. The main Disney &acute;parks&acute;, Seaworld, Universal Studios, Gatorland and waterparks are all around 15 minutes drive away. These are all must-sees in my opinion. International Drive is about a 5 minute car journey away or about 20 minutes walk. This area offered lots of entertainment, shopping and restaurants. We dined at a very good Greek Taverna offering home-made cuizine and also enjoyed a meal and good service at Cattleman&acute;s Steakhouse. We hired a Hummer through Alamo car hire. They provided professional service and this was an excellent vehicle. I would recommend this resort and area for a brilliant, fun and memorable holiday with a BIG &acute;wow&acute; factor.

30542,Empathology,Attractions,10/13/2013,Quite unique glimpse into Victorian London life (and death!),"There&acute;s nothing quite like the gothic splendour of Highgate Cemetery. Fantastically ornate graves and mausoleums jostle for space with decades of overgrown vegetation such that it looks like an inspiration behind countless horror movies. After decades of neglect, the cemetery is now locked and admission to the (more gothic) West side is by tour only (pre-booked during the week, turn-up at the door at the weekends). At 12 pounds it&acute;s pricey but in the hour your small party will be regaled with some fascinating history of the place, stories of life of at the time and gossip about the (many notable) people buried here. Your West side ticket allows free admission to the East side which, whilst less grandiose, is still worth a visit - if only to check out Mr Marx! It&acute;s a photographers dream but you&acute;re whisked around at a lick so be prepared to just snap randomly and hope for the best. I note another reviewers disappointment at not being allowed to see specific graves - and that is a problem so prepare for that well in advance.

The location of the hotel is very central and allows very easy access to pretty much anywhere in the city. While we covered everything from downtown to Central Park on foot from the hotel (we&acute;re big walkers) there is a subway stop literally a half a block down the street. There were plenty of restaurants/bars/etc within a stones throw as well. I was impressed with the modern look of the lobby and the level of service we received during our stay. Check in was quick and easy and as a Hilton Gold member I was given free breakfast during our stay which was a nice bonus. The room was very clean, updated, and surprisingly spacious for Manhattan.

I appreciated that Peter (hard to miss this elegant elderly man) accompanied me to the reception and explained to me all the amenities available in the hotel and the nearby places that would be of interest for my family when we checked-in. Three nights in this hotel proved to be too short. From check-in to check-out, everything was flawless. We got 2 executive rooms for my entire family. I only wished our rooms were on the same floor since we belonged to one party. The rooms given to us were on the 12th and 14th floor which proved to be a bit inconvenient. My children enjoyed the snacks during afternoon tea and the early evening cocktails. I liked the fact that they had a separate area in the lobby for the children during happy hour. The rooms were very clean and adequately stocked with the essential toiletries. The pool was quite small but still okay for children who just want to swim. The only thing that sorely needs to be improved is the gym. The machines there are quite old but still functional. An upgrade for the gym might be a good idea. The location was central to a lot of things. From malls to street markets, they were all within walking distance. There were a lot of restaurants around.

18501,CaffTwo,Hotels,9/21/2011,"Very good airport hotel, would recommend","We stayed here for one night before flying from Gatwick the following day, having booked a Park and Fly 16 Day package which got us a room and parking at the main airport Long Stay carpark, and were really impressed. The hotel is easy to find, directly connected to Gatwick&acute;s South Terminal, and our room was excellent with a king size comfy bed - I didn&acute;t sleep all that well due to excitement and never being able sleep anywhere on the first night in a strange bed but I felt very rested in the morning despite this. You can hear the planes but they&acute;re no louder than distant thunder really and stopped for most of the night as far as I could tell; I&acute;ve certainly stayed much further from an airport before and been bothered by plane noises a lot more than I was here.  We didn&acute;t eat in the hotel, opting to have dinner at the Giraffe in the South Terminal after completing Twilight Check-In, and having breakfast at the V Room (we were flying with Virgin Holidays). Checking in and out of the hotel was fast and efficient, although the small drop off car park right in front of the hotel was full when we arrived so we paid a couple of quid to park in the EuroStay carpark next door for 30 mins instead. The one thing we hadn&acute;t planned for was the use of open and closed zones in the Long Stay carpark - we parked in the open zone the night before, but the open zone had changed by the next morning when we went to drop our overnight things back in the car which meant the airport shuttle buses were only dropping off at our car park and not picking up. Not a major issue for us as it was sunny so we just walked back to the airport after dropping off our things (the other option was walking to the open zone to get a pick up bus from there) but something to bear in mind and it would have been a nuisance if it had been raining or we&acute;d been in a hurry - next time we&acute;d consider paying extra to stay in the carpark next door the night before for the convenience of having the car closer to hand in the morning, but we&acute;d definitely stay here again if flying from Gatwick.",5,1,101,Hilton London Gatwick Airport,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2667189-d239658-Reviews-Hilton_London_Gatwick_Airport-Gatwick_West_Sussex_England.html,Gatwick,2

It is just far enough away from the City Centre to be in a quiet location but the hotel and the rooms are decorated beautifully. The restaurants and bars are excellent, would thoroughly recommend the Steak and Lobster at ??15, was a lovely meal.  What makes this hotel stand out however is the quality of the staff. As you would expect for a Radisson everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, from arranging a lovely room for us to always ensuring everything was ok. A stand out member of staff was Elena on the reception desk when we checked out, she was very cheerful and was happy to share stories etc as we went through the process and also ensured my partner that she would care for her soft toy duck when we left our luggage behind!

30658,England1983,Hotels,7/4/2011,Amazing time at Caesars Palace!,"I travelled to Las Vegas with my husband for our belated honeymoon.  After a 10 hour flight it was nice to see a friendly face on reception at Caesars. Check-in itself was also very quick - we walked straight up to the desk - it was around 5pm.  The receptionist upgraded our room from the Forum Tower to the Palace Tower - the room in the Palace Tower was very nice indeed. Twin sinks, jacuzzi bath, shower and a very nice size bedroom. Our view was the back of the strip so not much to see really but at least it wasn&acute;t a brick wall staring back! When the receptionist checked us in he said that the room in the Palace Tower is nicer than the Forum Tower.  Before checking-in I was concerned about a deposit. I had read that they require cash deposit etc but the receptionist just swiped my bank card for security. No cash needed.  The hotel room was immaculate. Housekeeping attended every day and replaced towels and cleaned up. We had a problem with one of the wardrobe doors - it was basically broken. I mentioned it to reception on our way out one day (only because I didn&acute;t want the hotel think we were responsible) and when we came back later that day it had been fixed.  There was a safe in the wardrobe which was easy to use and large enough for what we needed it for.  We ventured into the pool area to have a look but didn&acute;t use the facilities - only because my husband isn&acute;t a lay around the pool type of person but it did look lovely. I would definitely make use of this if I returned with my friends on a girly break.  The Forum Shops are incredible! And you can access the hotel through these too.  I struggled with the air condition but that was everywhere - I love hot weather and was dressed to suit so when we went into the casinos or restaurants I became goose pimply within 15 minutes - but that&acute;s just me.  We wondered through Caesars very late (5am) on our way back from the strip on evening and a member of staff on the floor checked to see if the pizza place was open for us - which was very helpful of her. There were various bars and discos still open around 3am too.  Some friends that were in Vegas at the same time had gone to Pure Nightclub within Caesars - $20 for a vodka redbull! It looked a bit pretentious for me but I&acute;m sure it is still a brilliant night - personally I would rather head down to a Coyote Ugly type bar for a better atmosphere and cheaper drinks!  The location is perfect.  My only negative about the hotel is the price of the mini-bar - I was expecting the alcohol to be expensive but even the water and diet coke was $4 a pop. Once tax had been added my mini-bar total came to $30! I hadn&acute;t even had alcohol. But I knew this and so should have stocked up on soft drinks for the room whilst we were out...  I definitely want to return to Vegas and when I do I will stay at Caesars again - and back to the Palace Tower.",5,3,103,Caesars Palace,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d91762-Reviews-Caesars_Palace-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,Las Vegas,3

Firstly all the positive reviews about this hotel are completely bang on, The location, on the best part of the beach with the nicest coral reef to swim around nice jetty to walk out on and life guards- a prom to walk along to the other hotels. Hotel is set out over beautifully kept grounds, pools and room blocks. we were in block 14 top floor one twin and one double (as requested via email to hotel before we arrived) were excellent, ours weren&acute;t dark, plenty of lighting and clean. Housekeeping always came around 9.30am and left fab towel art in our room daily. The staff are run by what I can imagine is an excellent management team, always around to take drink orders, refill and clear away plates. Wherever you walked staff always smiled and spoke to us! Food... How an earth can anyone complain? Mostly freshly cooked excellent choice, everything you could possibly want we really enjoyed the meals and drinks provided. New Years Eve began with a cocktail party (the area was beautifully decorated) and countdown then firework display and then the disco, all the entrainment staff really worked hard to make it a very special night.. And it was!! Activity pool was heated, best time was as it was getting dusk around 4.30pm, lots going on all throughout the day and had a lovely vibe. Relax pool was exactly that, really chilled and the pool wasn&acute;t heated. Both pools have bars with friendly staff and good service. We only tipped when we felt service was completely amazing, staff do not expect it.. And we tipped in $1 bills which they were very happy with. Weather was brilliant, couple of days very windy, chilly at night but for a winter sun holiday you really couldn&acute;t go wrong.

If you walk towards the Westminster station, you will see the Burberry head office, to the Parliment buildings to the Big Ben - literally 15mins walk to the Westminster Abbey. Great service - over all is was a very modern, clean and chic boutique hotel. We had AC problems towards to end of our stay, we called for service a little after midnight and the manager came up to check on his in less than 5mins. All the staff are pleasant and very helpful.

But, being a Golden Circle member, I kinda felt a little loyalty and wanted to build my points, so I gave it a try. Not to mention the special promotion of stay two nights, get a third free.  What a find. I would have gladly paid for that third night for the experience I had at the Shang. The experience starts when you first enter the expanse of the lobby, looking straight out at the two story floor to ceiling windows facing the lush garden. Immediately I wanted to drop my bags and grab me one of those fruity drinks with an umbrella.  Rooms were pretty standard, but what gives this a five star rating is what you find outside of the room - the Lobby Bar, the swimming pool set in the garden, and the breakfast buffet. Being at the swimming pool makes one forgetful. You forget everything ??“ time, troubles, and that flight you have to take later in the day. It transports you to another zone, a zone where only happy things take place.  Then you go to the breakfast buffet, which was one of the best I have ever been to.

First 3 nights were through Hilton HHonors award. After reading several reviews, I wasn&acute;t quite sure what to expect since there were some valid customer service complaints on this website.  We chose this hotel due to the location of Paddington Station. Easy access to trains and the Heathrow Express.  I cannot stress how great the customer service of this hotel was from the moment we approached the check-in desk. We were upgraded to a suite for a price of 30 GBP/night.  Room was very nice - over 600 square feet. Had a separate sitting room with its own bathroom. Queen bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom was spacious with excellent shower pressure. Minibar had decent amount of space for personal items. Sitting room had its own minibar. Room was very clean. Carpet in great condition.  On second day of our stay, toddler and husband came down with flu. Husband contacted concierge for a doctor to check on toddler. Later, several hotel employees approached us to ask how the toddler was doing. Assistant manager of front desk even called to check on us.  Throughout the whole stay, almost every employee we ran into in the lobby addressed us by name. In such a huge hotel, how do they remember??  The Executive Lounge is decorated in modern themes. Great cold breakfast and evening appetizers. Big selection of beverages available throughout the day. There is a desktop computer with free internet service for people to use in the lounge, which was very helpful. Lounge employees were so nice to get us milk for toddler&acute;s bottle.  Concierge was extremeley helpful with ideas, arrangments and arranging help with luggage. In fact, even the concierge guy saw me with a baby bottle and asked if I needed milk!  Location of this hotel is awesome. Starbucks is next door. You don&acute;t even have to go outside to get to it. Grocery and drugstores with several eating options are in connecting Paddington Station. A 15 minute walk gets you to Kensington Gardens. Lots of eating options for all budgets nearby hotel.

The locations was great, too! We walked over to the Tower Bridge and crossed over it to the other side where the Tower of London is located.

You can hop on/off at any stop. It was nice to hear about the surroundings on the bus before reaching our destinations. Great , reasonably-priced way to travel for a family our size. It also included some walking tours (changing of the guards was great!).  To summarize, I have no complaints. The rooms were clean and spacious.

This hotel only has 8 floors but is very long. We requested a non-smoking room and a room on the highest floor but they could only give us the 5th floor and NON smoking. I found there was still some street noise which was a concern as I like absolute quiet but I slept very well. The beds were a little hard but otherwise good. The room was well appointed and looked exactly like their on-line pictures. There was an iron, ironing board, large tv, dvd player, kettle etc, in-room safe, clothes line over the bath, hairdryer and mini-bar. Beware of mini bar prices. Internet was $30 Singapore dollars per 24hours AND per connection so be careful. They supplied the normal shampoos etc and tea and coffee but no milk. The room temperature was easy to control.  The like to have $50 a day deposit to cover expenses.  Don&acute;t expect WiFi at McDonalds etc as you need to register first and to do that you have to use a local number but just go to the Tourist Information Office on Orchard Road and you can use it for 15 mins.  Room service was slow and the food cold and poor value for money. I ordered the Club Sandwich and it was very small and not worth the money.  Their buffet breakfasts were good with good variety and they even a special area for young children with toys and special breakfast food.  We used the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) trains to get around - very cheap and fast. It took us to most places we needed to get to. The taxis are also cheap but there is a peak hour surcharge which can double the price. It is all metered and the drivers are good. We took a taxi from Holiday Inn out to Singapore Zoo at 10:15am and it cost us $16.60 Singapore dollars. The MRT can get you out to the Singapore Flyer and to Chinatown and even out to Changi Airport. There are many different lines but it was easy to cross over.

Well our kids are 10 and 12 so that was out of the question!  It seemed we either had to fork out a fortune for a 2 bedroom suite or a second room. At one stage we actually considered the YMCA Family Room, due to how prohibitive the cost of a hotel was going to be!  Thankfully I found the Holiday Inn Orchard City Centre on Qantas Holidays. We booked a 2 x Double Room, which has 2 double beds, for a reasonable price.  As this hotel only has a 4 star rating I expected less than what we got. Less service, less wow factor. Upon entering the lobby our kids gasped. It was beautiful. Our room was also lovely. Apparently it has been refurbished recently and we were suitably impressed.  I can&acute;t comment on the breakfast or the pool area as we didn&acute;t utilise either.

Choices were great and the view in the breakfast room was beautiful. We often congregated in the lobby for drinks and the hotel bar was extremely reasonable. The pool was very warm and just gorgeous. Unfortunately, we were too early in the year to really enjoy the sun deck but imagine it is breathtaking when it is warm.  Our room was kept amazingly clean! Like I would do it at home, not just a daily spot check. It had a balcony with a table and chairs and enough space to sit outside and enjoy it (not the 2 foot wide kind you see at some places, an actual balcony). We unpacked our items into the spacious wardrobe and that freed up some space. There was a large mirror outside of the bathroom with a ledge for makeup and hair appliances which was very useful when you have 3 women sharing a room.  The location of the hotel is prime! Right across from the beach is the obvious one but out the back door of the hotel, you are a hop, skip and jump from restaurants and shopping, oh and Gelato! We were able to walk to the Eurospar to get snacks and any forgotten items. All in all, a great location! We found everything we needed and then some!  Now the real gem of the hotel is Armando!

4257,ASN1972,Hotels,1/3/2011,Unique architecture.,"I loved driving down the avenue, and driving up to this grand hotel with its mid 20th century modern design. Lobby seemed small and with not enough seating for people though.  We got it from Priceline for $95 so it was a bargain for us and I am rating it based on its beauty and bargain. We did not use any services, except for valet. We went in mid to late June so it was too cold to use the pool.  It&acute;s very close to the mall, which was nice. There are a lot of nice places to eat here and a supermarket, if you don&acute;t have a car. Apparently, a lot of celebs go shop here also. Bev Hills is not walking distance as I thought it would be acc. to Priceline on its map. You have to drive a bit, but Rodeo Drive is over-rated anyways, and I didn&acute;t buy anything.  I loved the room decor and especially the long and elegant corridors that were tastefully dark with dark wooden paneling and paintings. So I rate it 5 stars since we got it at a 2 star price! I&acute;d still give it 5 stars even if I paid $250 or $300 a night. I am too cheap to ever pay for that much a night for a room.",5,0,100,Hyatt Regency Century Plaza,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32655-d76442-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Century_Plaza-Los_Angeles_California.html,Los Angeles,3

The front desk associates were friendly and acted like they were glad that I was there. (This may seem like a no-brainer, but trust me... it isn&acute;t always the case!)  My room was clean and very comfortable. I had a very nice view from the room which overlooked the river. (I had a great evening walk along the river, and highly recommend it.) The hotel&acute;s internet speed worked well each evening in my room. This is a very important feature for a business stay.  I enjoyed the club lounge very much, too. They had a nice selection each evening including desserts and cordials. Well done.  Yes, I can recommend this hotel.

16967,Buff_G,Hotels,12/21/2012,Honeymoon Stay - UK Travellers.,"My Husband and I stayed here for 4 nights from December 9th through to December 13th. This stay was for our honeymoon. We booked our stay through the BA website along with our flights which totally came to ??2070.00. Before we left the UK I did email the hotel to let them know this trip was particularly special to us as it was our honeymoon . I had a lovely reply from a lady named Lucy. She assured us they would look after us when we arrived. We arrived at the hotel at about 2pm after taking a cab from JFK. I am not sure what time check in is supposed to be from but luckily our room was ready straight away. We were lucky enough to be given a corner room on the top floor of the hotel. The views were amazing. From the window we could see parts of Hell??™s Kitchen, the Hudson and the corner of Times Square. Our room number was 3625 on the 36th floor. The bed was huge and so comfy, the bathroom was well equipped with everything you could need on your stay and it was also very clean. Most importantly for me as I am a very light sleeper is that the room was very quiet. I would agree with pervious posters that the only slight annoying thing is the fact you have to pay for internet. We needed it so paid up. From memory I think it was $12.99 for 24 hours access. After arriving we unpacked our suitcases then headed out to Central Park. Upon our return we were surprised in our room with a bottle of chilled Proseco and some large chocolate covered Strawberries. Delicious! There were given to us with the compliments of the hotel. Touches like this really made our stay so special. The hotel offers a turndown service in the evenings which is a nice touch and the daily maid service was without fault. This was our fourth trip to NY and each time we have visited we have stayed in different hotels. I would say that this was definitely our favourite. The staff we encountered were all super friendly, helpful and professional and I wouldn??™t hesitate to stay here again. The location of the hotel for us couldn??™t have been better. We walked everywhere from the hotel, to Central Park, Bloomingdales, Times Square, Port Authority Bus Terminal (to get a bus to Woodbury Common) plus many other places. Just below the hotel is a burger restaurant that forms part of a small chain/ franchise (not sure which) It??™s called Shake Shack and my husband and I definitely recommend it. It??™s delicious! For breakfast we went to the West Way diner which is just around the corner or to a Starbucks depending on how hungry we were. Also right outside is the subway station which is very convenient. All in all I would definitely give this hotel 9 out of 10, the only thing stopping it from getting a full 10 is the fact you have to pay for the internet.  Well done InterContinental and its staff for giving us some great memories. If you have any questions about my trip or review please send me a private message. Hope this review has been helpful to you and thank you for reading.",5,3,103,InterContinental New York Times Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1646128-Reviews-InterContinental_New_York_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,3
21334,ChicagoLondon,Hotels,1/5/2011,Luxurious stay in Prime location,"I have never been to Paris and wanted the best hotel I could get with my Priority Club points. I booked a 3-night stay. I have Platinum Ambassador status with Intercontinental. A few days before arriving, I emailed the hotel and asked for an upgrade since I have a young child and needed space. I received a response promptly from the hotel indicating that I had been upgraded to an Executive Room. Upon arrival, bellhops took our luggage for us. The lobby is beautiful. The decor of this hotel is very grand and beautifully decorated. The check-in desk had 3 or 4 clerks working and they were all extremely busy checking people in. The gentleman who checked us in was very nice and welcoming. He spoke perfect English. He apologized that the hotel was fully booked and they could not give me an executive room, but guaranteed that they were giving me one of their most spacious Superior rooms with a balcony view of the Eiffel Tower. I told him I did not want a small rooms since that is the reputation of French hotel rooms. He kept assuring me that I would love the room. The day&acute;s room rates of the hotel were listed on the wall. The Superior room had 780 Euros so I figured it had to be decent. Elevators, hallways, etc. all very nice. French paintings on the walls in the hallways. With great anticipating, we opened the door to our room on the 4th floor and were extremely pleased. We had room Carcine 4234. The room was very large. We had two large beds. Two large closets for both of us to keep our items. A large bathroom with separate shower. Grand lux bedding and curtains. Room color scheme was rich red and creamy yellow tones. The balcony was long and narrow, but large enough to enjoy taking solo walks back and forth to get in some good exercise. The Eiffel Tower was in full view. At night it would sparkle. So magnificent! Shortly after we were walking around the room, yes it was that big, 2 bellhops came to deliver our luggage. Very excited and happy, addressing us by Monsieur and our last name and Mademoiselle and our last name and even Mademoiselle to my young daughter! The hotel also sent our Ambassador membership amenities, which were a couple bottles of water, glasses, fruit bowl, French wafers, plates and utensils.  Concierge was very help, specifically Roger. They all spoke very good English. If they don??™t know something, they quickly tried to find out the answer. Gave good recommendations and directions for specific restaurants and activities. They arranged a van service to pick us up and take us out to Versailles one afternoon. Bistros and all kinds of boutiques surround hotel. Galeries Lafayette down the road. Beautiful, fashionable people in the hotel and outside. Very safe area.  We did not dine in the restaurant, but did order room service one night. Very expensive menu but service is very good. 17 Euros for a kid&acute;s burger and fries. 10 Euros for a Coke.  I have to say this hotel exceeded my expectations. Located in a wonderful location, this hotel is very posh. Wonderful customer service. I highly recommend this property.

8697,Anrmd,Hotels,12/25/2010,High Marks for Service and Location,"Spent a week at this hotel for the Winter Break Holiday. Hotel is clean, attractively appointed, and is within walking distance of most of the South Beach highlights. There are a lot of young kids here but this is to be expected given it is a school holiday week. The hotel also has a large contingent of European travelers (probably true all over Miami given location).  The hotel staff could not be any more polite and friendly. We really were impressed with how personable and service oriented EVERY hotel employee we encountered was. Seems like a simple formula.... why don&acute;t more hotels/resorts grasp this concept?  Hotel had lots of nice little touches such as: cold towels and free suntan lotion spray at pool. Free samples of ice cream, smoothies, and frozen banana bites at the pool also. Pool area is nice and has several jacuzzis. They have lots of shade umbrellas. I like their policy of giving people printed time limits when they leave there seats. For instance, you can&acute;t just leave a towel there at 6AM and expected to hold the seat all day. If you leave your seats they usually give you an hour or so to come back or they will offer the seats to other guests- makes it fair.  Room was clean and comfortable although efficiently spaced. Large flat screen TV. We had a room with its balcony directly facing the beach. The hotel pool has a gate that leads right to the beach after walking across the narrow boardwalk. That is, beach is right there next to hotel. You have to pay a private company for beach chair/ umbrella rental $$ as this is not done by the hotel. This company also rents water craft,etc.  Hotel has a dining room. Buffet was decent but a little pricey ($28.50) but only $9.50 for kids. There is a separate coffee bar, ice cream parlor, and a very decent sushi bar. There is also Emeril&acute;s restaurant next door at the hotels other building- liked our dinner here. Did not like that the hotel adds a service charge of 20% even if you order a buffet- don&acute;t mind tipping but this seems excessive. They also leave a blank on the slip if you want to add more tip on top of the 20% - seems excessive and it was probably the only thing here I would criticize.  Room was nice and clean. Bed/ bedding were very decent. My wife commented that the shower products were not as nice as she might have expected. Room has a safe large enough to hold our small Mac laptop and some other items. Bathroom is a little small but not too bad. Shower only, no bathtub in our room.  One quirk: the internet is free in the lobby,restaurant,etc but there is fee to use it in your room.  We really like Spiga (Italian restaurant) which is located 7 or 8 blocks south on Collins Ave. Great, authentic food, not pretentious and reasonably priced. Did NOT care for Yuca rest. on Lincoln Rd - uninspired Cuban Food and lackluster service (despite an also included 20% service charge.  Overall, a very nice place to stay (Loew&acute;s). Would strongly consider staying here again if we return to South Beach for another vacation.",5,2,102,Loews Miami Beach Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34439-d256986-Reviews-Loews_Miami_Beach_Hotel-Miami_Beach_Florida.html,Miami Beach,3

19477,Captain_DaveMontreal,Hotels,4/17/2011,Great meeting place,This hotel is located above the departures terminal at the Pierre Elliot Trudeau International Airport (YYZ or closest airport to Montreal).  Our company held a conference here for out-of-town guests and they were pleased with the hotel and convenient location. The hotel is only a few years old and has a trendy design.  I did not use a hotel room but our guests said they were good and one guest staying on the airport side of the hotel said she could not hear any noise from the airport.  Adjacent to the lobby they have small glass meeting rooms to rent for about $50/day. There are also several large and medium size conference rooms located on the lobby level.  Food was good. One night they even had a chef from Schwartz&acute;s Deli (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartz&acute;s) serving up smoked meet sandwiches. Another night we had a poutine station. Both being local/Quebec staples for anyone visiting the city.  I will definately recommend this hotel to anyone visiting on business. Especially if the traveller is meeting any of the companies located near the airport or West Island.  Travel time to downtown from this hotel is about 30 minutes without traffic. During rush hour it will take a good hour.  The hotel offers a shuttle bus for a nominal fee. Some of our guests said this was a convenient and cost effective way to get downtown.  If you are visiting Montreal for vacation you should look at a downtown hotel to put you within walking distance of sites and attractions. If you have an early morning flight the Marriott Airport would be a great stop for your last night.  There are no restaurants outside the hotel within walking distance. There are several high end and family restaurants that can be reached with a short taxi ride.,5,1,100,Montreal Airport Marriott In-Terminal Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g181732-d1514315-Reviews-Montreal_Airport_Marriott_In_Terminal_Hotel-Dorval_Quebec.html,Dorval,3

5812,AlabamaTraveler0,Hotels,7/21/2010,Great location and value,"My wife and I stayed at this location July 16 to 19 (check in on a Friday afternoon and check out on Monday morning).  Access: We arrived in New York on Amtrak at Penn Station at about 2 PM on Friday. We decided that we would use public transport to get from the station to the hotel. At Penn Station we followed the signs in the station to the #1 subway line. Since we would be in town for four days, we purchased a 1 week Metrocard for $27. The #1 comes about every 8 minutes on weekday afternoons, so we did not have to wait long for a train. Then we rode the #1 towards South Ferry for 10 stops and got off at Rector Street. The ride takes about 15 minutes and at that time of the day we were able to find plenty of seats, and had room for our luggage. At Rector Street exit towards Rector Street, and then walk down Rector Street to either West Street and to the front of the hotel, or to Washington Street and the back door of the hotel (right next to the Starbuck&acute;s).  Check In: We checked in at 3 PM and check in was efficient and the staff gave us an area map and pointed out a nearby grocery store. We are Platinum Members, but the concierge lounge closes Friday after breakfast and does not reopen until Sunday evening. Thus, as a rule there is no free breakfast on Saturday or Sunday mornings.  Hotel: The hotel is 38 stories, with the Concierge Lounge on the 38th floor. We were on the 34th floor (Room 3411) and had a room that faced the Hudson. You could see New Jersey (including a giant Colgate clock that had a neon glow at night) and Ellis Island. You can see the Statue of Liberty from the Concierge lounge, so I suspect you could also see the statue from rooms on that side of the hotel. The room was appointed like a typical Marriott. Our king room had a refrigerator and a nice sized bathroom. The room was pretty large for New York, and well kept. There is also a turndown service at night.  Nearby: Since we had a refrigerator in the room we decided we would go to a nearby grocery store and get some sodas and breakfast items. There is a Gristedes at 315 South End Avenue that is a pretty well stocked grocery where we bought some breakfast stuff (cross over West Street and go down Albany Street about 1 block).  While there is no self service laundry at the hotel or within walking distance, there is a drop off laundry that charges by the pound near Gristedes (closed on Sundays only). There is also a pharmacy in the same strip as Gristedes, if you need medicine.  Food: While I said above that as a rule there is no free breakfast on the weekends, we did have a free breakfast at the hotel. On Friday night when we came back to the hotel, we found that the desk clerk had left a welcome note under our door. With the note there was a coupon for a free breakfast for two in the hotel restaurant for Saturday morning and a coupon for one free in room movie. The breakfast in the restaurant was superb- my wife had pancakes with fresh berries and I had a breakfast tacos with chorizo. There was also a buffet, that would be $22 without a coupon. Other than breakfast we did not eat in their restaurant.  There are not a large number of restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but more likely than not leisure visitors will pick up food when out and about town. The room refrigerator came in very handy with all the leftovers. There is an all night sandwich shop and pizza store nearby. Also there is a PJ Clarke&acute;s nearby, but we never are there.  On Sunday night the Concierge Lounge was open. There was an honor bar, free drinks, and light food. In the evening the lounge had a warm pasta dish, some type of savory pastries, and cookies. You could definitely make a meal out of the amount of items they offered, though we didn&acute;t have any since we had already eaten.  For breakfast in the lounge they offered scrambled eggs, toast, breakfast meats, fruit, oatmeal, etc.  Location: We found this location ideal for a vacation stay, and preferable to a Midtown or Times Square hotel. The hotel is very close to many subway lines but does not have the oppressive crowds you would find in Midtown. The hotel is just over 2 blocks from the #1 train that can take you to most of the main tourist areas or to the South Ferry to catch the Staten Island Ferry. Other lines nearby were the R, N, 4, and 5- all of which we found useful.  If you are looking for last minute show tickets do not go to the the TKTS booth in Midtown. Rather, take the R train for a 7 minute ride from Rector Street to Lawrence Street Station in Brooklyn, and visit the TKTS Brooklyn. It is a faster trip and there are smaller lines (no lines when we visited Friday afternoon). Also, the Brooklyn TKTS lets you buy matinee tickets for the next day, something you cannot do in Midtown.  Price/Value: This was the lowest priced Marriott in Manhattan or Brooklyn the weekend we stayed in New York, so we felt we got an especially good bargain.  Negatives: There were no real negatives. The only possible annoyance some may find is that this hotel is very near the World Trade Center site, so there is some minor construction noise after 9 AM (we only heard some after about 9 AM on Saturday, and none on Monday or Sunday). This should not stop you from staying here as overall the hotel is very quiet, the noise was minimal, and if this is an issue, I imagine they would try to put you on the side of the hotel opposite the construction.  Overall: The staff was friendly and helpful, the price was unbeatable, and the location was ideal.",5,8,108,New York Marriott Downtown,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93477-Reviews-New_York_Marriott_Downtown-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,3

15999,Brazil_Fan1,Hotels,1/7/2009,Great Time at the Rose!,"We stayed at the Rose the week of New Years and had a fantastic time there. This was our second visit to the Rose and we enjoyed our stay just as much as the first time around. The location was perfect for us with 2 kids, right on the beach and walkable into town. The large pool was great for the kids, who spent the entire week either in the pool or in the ocean. The pool staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Our room was clean and updated. And we found both the housekeeping staff and concierge to be very friendly and helpful when we needed them. In fact when we arrived at the airport, I called the hotel to see if they had a hotel shuttle that could pick us up. They didn&acute;t but they did make arrangements with a private shuttle service that was already at the airport to meet us and drive us to the Rose. The Concierge also booked us a whale watching cruise which was outstanding.  Our room was very nice, clean and comfortable, and they happily accommodated our request to be close to the ocean.  There are vendors on the beach, who sell jewelry, clothes and other souvenirs. They are many of them all over Cabo. At first they are somewhat annoying, but a simple no gracias"""" sends them away. They are all licensed and are just trying to make a living. I was impressed by their ability to work up and down the beach in the hot sun all day carrying heavy loads of merchandise.  Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would return again. Can&acute;t think of many things to complain about.

We were celebrating my Cousin turning 40 and wanted someplace clean , nice bathroom close to times square, young and Fresh. We found it. I didn&acute;t mind the neighborhood at all. Not once did I feel unsafe. there was so much close by. We had 2 double beds and it was tight. It was also nice to have the fridge if even just over night. Breakfast was free and with that in mind it was really really good. Better than I&acute;ve had in Holiday inn, hampton inn ....The problem ws it was really crowded But lots of fun everyone was in a good mood and it seemed like a party. We were able to leave our luggage with the Door Man. Door Man is an understatement Jamie should have a better title.

Bring a blanket if you want to sit on the ground. We sat on the bench over looking the large pond and really enjoyed ourselves! Go on a weekday!!!! We went on a Friday, and it was pretty crowded, but had no problem getting in a tour. Take the tours and ask questions!! We had a wonderful group of people and it brought out so many more details that the tour guide would not have even covered if someone had not asked. Our tour was very laid back, but lasted longer than expected and it was a plus for myself. Very worth the time, since it is free!!!! Stay atleast 3 hours, or 8 even! There are so many fantastic pieces to see! Best views are outside on the the upper floors of the art galleries. Take a photo from the outside overlooking LA, Belle Aire, and the coast!! Terrific view! Wishing we could have taken our picnic to this area but no food allowed! Take time to see it on your own, too! Last tip: Pay attention to what level you park on!

I stayed at this property two separate times during my trip to Asia. The first night i stayed there I was upgraded to a Grand room which was wonderful. For Hong Kong standards the room was a good size, the turnover service was complete before the time I had checked in. I like the chocolates they left on the bed. The Grand room has a bigger bathroom than the Deluxe room and has a door that opens to look into the room or the TV which was cool. If you are hungry late night there is a McDonalds accross the street that is open 24/7 but you have to go underground to cross the street. The bed was very comfortable and they were able to give me a late check out.  For the second stay i was put in a Deluxe room. The room was ok but needed some work done to it. I&acute;m not sure if it was just the room I was in that needed work but there were some exposed wire behind the worek desk which was a bit concerning and there were not many power outlets available like the grand room. Besides that, the room was nice. I didn&acute;t get a chance to check out the other facilities in this hotel since I arrived late at night and just needed a place to sleep.

I asked for an upgrade and was told no free upgrades to 3rd party bookings. Upgrade to suite was available at a cost. I passed since only 1 night stay. I asked for a nice, quiet room away from noisy housekeeping and ice machine. Received room 10-120. Room was huge with 2 beds. Felt like 400 square feet. Newly renovated last year. Bell hop told me some rooms are very small so I totally lucked out! Service from start to finish was top notch. Everyone had a smile on their face. Always spoke with great respect and made us feel welcome. Ordered room service at 10:45 PM. Arrived in 1/2 hour. food was so-so. Had pancakes in Lockwood for breakfast.

12589,Beaches2626,Hotels,10/5/2014,Perfection,"We booked a Prem Deluxe Riverview Room with Butler Service but upon being shown to our room we realized it was not the style that we had in mind. The hotel has 4 distinct styles from Florence, Renaissance to more modern. We were expecting a Renaissance style room. We were informed that no room in the category we booked was available in Renaissance style. However, there was a Renaissance room available absent the river view. We were escorted to room 332, this ??˜lower??™ category room was 2x the size and had an amazing view of all the terracotta roofs of Florence and the Duomo. The bathroom and closest room were also 2x the size. The room with a river view had no tub.  In short the room was perfection, every detail. I didn??™t want to leave; illustrated by the fact we cancelled our hotel in Switzerland in order to spend another couple days at the St. Regis Florence. Since we had already paid for the upgraded room the St Regis gave us free breakfast every morning to make up the difference. Breakfast was an event. The balcony of the Winter Garden Ballroom was amazing. The food was great, fresh omelet station, pancakes and french toast made to order. Likewise, the nightly champagne ritual was the perfect way to start the evening. Every night from 7-8pm the bar used sabers to break open champagne bottles. The champagne is accompanied by a light trio of bites prepared by the chef and oysters. The bartenders even let guests keep the champagne bottle tops as souvenirs.  Customer service was amazing, from turn down service to the daily tea/coffee/snacks included in the Butler Service everything was quick and friendly. Special thanks to the Guest Experience Manager, Ombretta Comito who is the reason we got the room of our dreams and Aldo Maestosi, warmest kindest service truly. Originally, we were torn between the St Regis and Four Seasons. We are lucky we went with St Regis, we visited the Four Seasons for dinner, which we highly recommend for a dinner visit only, it was far out of the way - over a 35 minute walk to downtown Florence and all the museums. If you stay at the Four Seasons you are going to be constantly paying for cabs. The St Regis is centrally located, 5 -15 minute walk to all the major attractions.  If you take a trip into Tuscany to try some wines, make sure to visit Casa Sola. The owner, Mateo gives the tour himself not some international intern that speaks English. Casa Sola is the real deal, small operation, private, beautiful and authentic.

All three have been great but with a little room for improvement. However, this time we&acute;ve decided to stay at the Trump because its one of the newest ones in Vegas, plus it does not have a casino - which I thought would&acute;ve been a nice change. Plus we got a really good deal online via booking.com.  We arrived at the hotel to check in at around 11pm on a Saturday night. The hotel appeared to be quiet but not dead. Still with great service and everyone had sincere smiles. Not only was our check in process sweet and simple, the hotel even offered us a complimentary upgrade to a 1000 sq ft one bedroom suite. We were speechless. What a pleasant surprise.  Everyone working for the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly. Room was clean and spacious. The pool was nice too, but not as big as the ones you see at the other Casino Hotels / Resorts on the Vegas strip.  The hotel also offers free shuttle services to the Wynn and Caesars Palace every 15mins from 9am until midnight. This hotel is a 2 mins walk away from the Fashion Show Mall, 10 mins walk to the Vegas strip.

My husband and I stayed in a room with a balcony which faced Central Park.. beautiful! We were all happy with the accommodations. My husband and I have been staying here for three years as a getaway in the city, but this time we brought the boys. Typically, the two of us have stayed in the studio plus rooms which are also very nice. If you drive in, you can have your car valet parked in a garage for $48/day. I priced other garages around the area, but none beat their price for 24 hrs.  LOCATION!! This hotel is walking distance to our favorite places: Central Park, Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center, Times Square, MoMa, Rockefeller Center, and more. Of course, if you want to go further away it&acute;s easy to walk to the subway and get there. This visit we went to One World Observatory. It took about 30 minutes to get there.  We have stayed at Hilton Hotels in the USA and abroad and have always been pleased with our stay. The only Hilton Timeshares we have stayed in are this one and Tuscany Village in Florida. This property isn&acute;t a typical timeshare. The rooms don&acute;t have kitchens nor is there a marketplace or restaurant on site. However, at no additional price, owners can use the owner&acute;s lounge to eat breakfast daily and have food and drinks 5-7 (not a sit-down meal).

16353,Briman111,Hotels,3/9/2012,Simply Incredible!!,"If is difficult to describe how fantastic this hotel is in every way!!! I was there for a three-day work conference in the beginning of March. Now, I have been to the casino before, I have never stayed in the rooms. From the minute I got dropped off by the taxi until the time I left, it was an amazing experience. Check in was smooth (the $20 trick and little white lie worked for an upgraded room to higher floor, strip view and some chocolate covered strawberries sent to the room). The rooms are huge and nicely decorated. The lights and shades are all electronic, which is really cool. (Check out some of the videos on youtube!). The bathrooms are also very large and very well stocked with robes, slippers, towels, toiletries, and misc basket of stuff like shoe polish and nail file.  As I mentioned before, I was at a work event, so I was able to experience how well the hotel accommodated conferences. Again, nothing but complements. The food served was delicious, and they even checked with the chef about gluten concerns since my girlfriend has a gluten intolerance. The service at the events was perfect. All eight of us at the table were served at the exact same time!! The water and wine glasses never got empty, unless you specifically tell them to stop pouring.  Every employee you walk by, says hi. The cocktail service while gambling is top shelf....literally! Whatever you want to order, they will bring...and pretty quickly too! But, this does remind me of one tiny fault. I slipped a twenty into the video poker machine at the bar and was betting $1 per hand. I ordered a drink, and they charged me full price ($9.50) for the drink. I was actually quite surprised, as I could have been betting $0.30 on the floor and get the same drink for free. But, that is the only complaint.  I hope some day I get the opportunity to stay there again. I don&acute;t think I would pay to stay there, as I would much rather take the extra $200/night and put in my gambling budget while staying at a mid-level hotel.  So, in conclusion.

11128,BMWilliams1982,Restaurants,4/19/2012,Superb and a credit to Cardiff,"Bully&acute;s is a great example of what happens when people love what they do and care about how they do it.  The first thing to comment on is how the passion and enthusiasm of the owners comes through every facet of this restaurant, from the d?©cor and atmosphere to the food and service. This makes for a special, intimate experience far beyond the capabilities of most restaurants and on a different planet to the homogenised chains that dominate Cardiff.  Located in the leafy suburb of Pontcanna/Canton Bully&acute;s is a stone&acute;s throw (or cheap taxi) from the centre and on a nice day or night, the area has some great bars and venues to check out before or after. On arrival we were greeted by the Russell and Dewi and seated in a large booth to ourselves which was great. The restaurant is cosy and you cannot see the walls for memorabilia all over it, nice touch. It was quiet when we were there, but I can imagine this place is great when full, buzzing and loud. Dewi set about explaining the menu and wine choices and left us to decide. Iv&acute;e had fine dining experiences before, and there is sometimes a pretentious feel to the occasion, which is off-putting and elitist - not here! The guys were laid back, very helpful and you really had the sense that you were eating at there home.  The menu was in perfect &acute;sixes&acute;, 6 starters, 6 mains and 6 desserts which is enough to choose from but plenty of variety. Before our starters arrived we had an &acute;Amuse Bouche&acute; which is basically a little taster to get you going, this was a delicious espresso cup of soup with home-made hot bread - fantastic! The starters were superb and inevitably left you wanting much more, the smoked trout was meaty but delicate and not even a hint of the earthiness that can sometimes come with freshwater fish. The foie gras was served slightly rare which left it creamy and delicious. For mains we had pork tenderloin and duck. The pork was incredible, the tenderloin is such a hard cut to cook without drying it out, this was moist and soft with an amazing mushroom sauce. The duck was equally great, served perfectly pink with an expert fondant potato and sauce.  As it is a French restaurant, not having desert would be a sin. It was as fantastic as expected, the highlight being the Tarte Tatin with in inspired &acute;Pear Drop&acute; ice cream - amazing.  All of this with a bottle of lovely French red wine came to ??90, which was surprisingly good value for such great food, in my opinion the highest quality food available in Cardiff. For a special occasion or just a splurge on fine dining Bully&acute;s is the perfect choice.

Although we only used the hotle to sleep an and had breakfast the next mornigh the experience was well worth it. The place is steeped in Victorian history and plenty of items, pictures and artifacts are placed around the floors to givre an insight into the history of this magnificent building. Our room was on the first floor and was very clean with a comfortable bed and pillows to die for. The paintwork on the window frames left a bit to be desired, but thats the only complaint. I could not fault my stay. Checking out was a bit lengthy as we queued for some time, before being told we could just drop keys into the desk as we had payed on arrival.

31387,EuropeanPete,Hotels,11/18/2010,Beautiful Conrad in a great Tokyo location,"I stayed here for 6 nights in an upgraded room as a redemption of Hilton points over new year&acute;s.  It&acute;s quite a modern, designer hotel, with particularly nice rooms - my favourite ever shower.  I want to make a particular call-out for the swimming pool looking out over Tokyo and the associated spa area. Fantastic way to spend the first hour or two of a day.  The executive lounge is great, with a wonderful breakfast (incl. omelettes made to order by a chef and fantastic pastries). There are little touches which make it all the more enjoyable - like the micro laptop with free Internet that you can borrow. They were under instructions of the GM to play only on CD in the lounge whilst I was there which was mind-numbing, but I hope some suitably robust feedback has moved things on somewhat.  There are a couple extremely expensive restaurants (incl. a Gordon Ramsey) which I didn&acute;t try, but looked high quality. Something a bit more reasonable might have been nice - I didn&acute;t feel like paying $60 for a hamburger and so had to venture downstairs when in search of hangover food.  This is one of the slickest 5-star hotels I&acute;ve ever been in, but in Tokyo the competition is high. At relatively similar pricing levels, I opt for the Park Hyatt as preference, even without the lounge.",5,2,102,Conrad Tokyo,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1066451-d571809-Reviews-Conrad_Tokyo-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,Minato,6
31815,FDanvers,Hotels,12/28/2009,One of top 3 hotels I have stayed in,"Returned here in Dec. 2009 with my partner after having stayed here in Dec. 2008. Both times my stay was paid for by HHonors Points and both times I felt immensely privileged to stay in such a marvelous place. Can only amplify another reviewer&acute;s statement that I simply wanted to move in and live here. Last year I moved from the Park Hotel next door (highly recommended for the excellent price-quality ratio) and was stunned at the sheer size of the room after the customary tiny rooms that I had experienced in Japan.  Had a bay view room in 2008 and city view this time round. Both rooms are equal in all respects with regard to layout, design, etc., but the bay room certainly has my preference for the stunning day and night views across Tokyo Bay, right to Odaiba.  The very high JPY 2,500 daily charge for the swimming pool was waived due to HHonors membership, which we only discovered when my partner went to the pool (I would advise the hotel to inform guests of HHonors benefits when checking in). My partner had a swim at sunrise and shared the pool for a few minutes only with another guest and found the pool the most stunning ever, possibly only equalled by the pool at the JW Marriott in the Jin-Mao tower in Shanghai. Partner&acute;s comment: even if the daily rate was paid for the pool it would have been well worth it.  Whereas the hotel stands head and shoulders above most of the other 5-star hotels I have stayed in before, some nice touches I noticed in 2008 seemed to have disappeared, added to which some small glitches appeared in what for the rest was excellent service: - no welcome fruit/snack upon arrival as was the case in 2008; - the staff member who escorted us to our room asked about 4 or 5 times whether we had further questions (we repeatedly answered no), until we realized he was clearly fishing for a tip - this left us very uncomfortable and highly confused as other staff members had consistently refused tips, once or twice citing the Japanese custom not to give tips; - the specially-for-Conrad Shiseido toiletries had been replaced by perfectly good quality but less nice Acca Kappa products; - the person receiving guests in the lounge made us feel very unwelcome and highly uncomfortable for not ordering a drink while enjoying the view of the bay for only a few seconds, even though we had indicated we only wanted a quick look in an area where drink orders are not compulsory (I checked this beforehand! there was not a single other person in the lounge and given our attire and arms full of shopping bags we clearly were on our way to our room); we did not sit down and had not intention to do so, instead only standing at the windows for no more than about 10 seconds; - was surprised to learn hotel is only 4 years old as both last year&acute;s and this year&acute;s rooms showed some serious wear and tear; numerous scuff marks, damage to furniture, many stains on woodwork, cracked tiles, etc.; this was more than compensated for by excellent design and very high quality furniture, e.g. Eames desk chair that is rarely seen and never in hotels.  For every glitch I can possibly list a dozen good points, so on balance the Conrad rates tops in my book. One good example: in 2008 I left my luggage at the hotel while traveling to Kyoto for 4 days and found the hotel perfectly willing to store my bulky luggage free of charge for up to 3 weeks.  As indicated already, the stay was free given that it was paid for by HHonors points, but I definitely will return as a paying guest, hopefully in the very near future as I am willing to pay seriously for such luxury and comfort.",5,2,102,Conrad Tokyo,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1066451-d571809-Reviews-Conrad_Tokyo-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,Minato,6

17128,Bunnydots,Hotels,5/3/2013,Nice quiet stay - worth the money,"Chose this hotel because it was one of the very few that had 11 straight nights free that I needed on short notice for a business trip. As I realized, it&acute;s very hard to find that many nights free at a hotel in London unless you book way early, and I worried a bit whether the hotel might have some undesirable quality that resulted in that much availability - but my worries were completely unfounded and it turned out to be a very nice quiet stay.  Great location right across from Blackfriars station and a historic pub and park. Starbucks and Caffe Nero are within a block. My room was VERY quiet despite being right by the elevator. I am used to hearing a lot of noise from maids, elevators and other guests, and I heard very little which was great as I needed to work in my room during part of each day. Room had big comfy bed, was generally clean and spacious, with plenty of work space on a desk with outlets as well as a sitting room area with couch, chair and coffee table. Big closet space with drawers and nice hangers, ironing board, good sized in-room safe. Furniture and air conditioning all looked new and worked great. Bathroom was clean, fixtures looked new, lots of towels provided and big complimentary bathrobes. Complimentary tea setup with a pot, tea bags, cookies and chocolate was refreshed daily. There&acute;s also a minibar although you don&acute;t really need it because the Tesco Express is literally steps outside the back door.  Staff were nice, provided excellent service and especially conscientious about wake-up calls (they have a deal where if you don&acute;t get your call then your room is free - which on some days resulted in my getting more than one call. Had the in-room dining twice and it was very good, especially the dim sum from the Chinese Cricket Club restaurant in the hotel. Housekeeping was also generally good - they missed vacuuming once or twice and put the hot pot away with water in it once causing me to spill a lot of water when I went to get it out again.  Most importantly the hotel gave me FREE INTERNET because i was staying so long, which I REALLY appreciated since I need this for work and do not enjoy having to pay an extra 16 to 20 pounds for it a day - ridiculous amount for something that&acute;s becoming a business necessity. Over 11 days stay this cost would have really added up for me and it&acute;s something I always think hotels should include in their basic rate, at least if they have many business travelers.  The main complaint I had was that the bathroom, although clean and new, had very low hot water pressure in the tub and shower (sink was fine) and the ergonomics were not good. The tub is deep like it&acute;s for baths, but due to the hot water coming out in a trickle, bathwater was cold by the time you got the tub filled. Tub is raised with no grab bar to help one get in and out, causing me to have to hold onto the wall, and I almost slipped and fell once. If you don&acute;t close the door firmly it swings open while you&acute;re on the loo, hitting you in the knees - and it&acute;s quite heavy. Magnifying mirror was installed at the height for a tall man and could not be adjusted up and down so being a short female, I had to sit on the sink to be tall enough to use it. Also it would be good if a waterproof surface with an outlet was provided somewhere for one to make tea - I ended up making it on the desk every morning as there was no place else, and over time the heat and splashing on the desk is likely to take the finish off.",5,0,100,Crowne Plaza London - The City,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d293286-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_London_The_City-London_England.html,London,6

The questionable turret architecture aside, this is really a great hotel in a location that is obviously there for the airport, but not especially close, on the edge of the hotels on the Bath Road. So, it&acute;s fair to say that you don&acute;t want to be where the hotel is - but it&acute;s on a bus route, not far from the Piccadilly Line, and in a reasonable area with some food options if on a budget.  That said, the bar food is excellent, not too expensive for a hotel, and the service impeccable. Rooms, for the price level, are spectacular - comfortable, stylish, and spacious. Beds are superb and I slept brilliantly despite a late finish and early start.  Criticisms? I&acute;m scraping the bottom of the barrel but the TVs are bit small, and there&acute;s no gym on site, which would have been nice given the quality of the hotel.

Breadroom was very clean and tidy, nice LG flat screen, bed was very comfortable (although the duvet looked very very lumpy), tea/coffee and toiletories were supplied, and we could control the temperature. Breakfast was nice, simple but nice, cereal, fruit, yogurt, hot buffett (usually egg and sausage patties), juices, breads, bagels, muffins etc. All in all, great hotel for what you need, central, clean, basic, friendly and comfortable beds. would definitely recommend it and would definitely go back!",5,0,100,Hampton Inn Madison Square Garden,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d498869-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Madison_Square_Garden-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,6

The hotel lived up to our expectations.

Both rooms were lovely, the executive being slightly larger. I had emailed the hotel prior as I wanted to celebrate our friends recent 30th birthday and my husbands upcoming 40th, both rooms had balloons and also gorgeous slices of cake. The rainshower was heaven after our New Year celebrations! Free WIFI with excellent connection. The staff were really friendly and looked pleased to be there even though they were working over the New Year. Breakfast in the hotel was expensive compared to Mimis a few doors down with a full breakfast for ??3.80! Also had lunch in The Sawyers Arms down the road and that was good food in nice surroundings. Also recommend Below Zero restaurant under the IceBar, get a Tastecard trial membership and you will get 2 for 1 meals, we saved ??50! Our stay was topped off by a trip to the darts, Barny and Taylor got knocked out but it was a fantastic night!

24197,Cynicor,Hotels,12/21/2011,Great hotel,"Stayed here for the F1 in Singapore, 2011  Overall an excellent stay at one of the top hotels in Singapore.  We had only a 3 night stay to sample this hotel and the F1 before moving to our usual haunt, the Fairmont. We had a Pacific Club room on a high floor.  We had been warned that the wait for elevators was a sore point, but the club/higher floors have their own set and we did not notice a longer-than-average wait time.  The room was large, clean and well furnished and a few added touches were a nice surprise. There was a little stand with 8 magnetic containers of snacks such as chocolates and nuts, and also a little pan pacific gift for us on the pillow. The welcome letter also explained that non-alcoholic beverages were free from the minibar for pacific club guests, and a host of other benefits.  We had a partial view of the track from our room so could see the cars whizzing about at night. The only disadvantage to the hotel&acute;s proximity to the F1 was the noise of the cars, and also the after party which went on until about about 3am or so each night, and could be heard clearly even on our floor. If you go during the F1 and are a light sleeper, they supply some earplugs in the room in anticipation.  The club was quite beautiful and spread over 2 levels, one for breakfast and one for the evening (called Sunrise and Sunset). The club was very quiet when we were there and we frequently had the place to ourselves. You also had a good view of parts of the track if wanting to see the F1 in air-conditioned comfort. The evening cocktails were the standard red/white/champagne offering but also included real cocktails and a selection of spirits, while the food offered was very nice and the warm dishes were cooked to order (but speedily). The continental selection, desserts and cheeses were all out at the buffet and the desserts were especially tasty.  Breakfast could be taken in one of 3 areas (club, main restaurant and an extra conference room converted to breakfast use due to the hotel occupancy). Breakfast was nice and as a bonus had roti prata, even in the lounge. Overall the breakfast was not quite at the level of the Fairmont or the Fullerton but you definately won&acute;t leave hungry and I did not notice it lacking in any specific areas.  We did not use the gym facilites, pool, room service or other restaurants this stay, but the pool looked nice and not too crowded.  The location is good but not as convenient for the MRT, and during the F1 numerous road closures mean you need to plan your trip a bit more, and we had an issue with a taxi driver not wanting to take us there due to traffic. Another took us home with no problems and we saw no traffic... The nearest MRT is Esplanade station on the new circle line (CC) but more useful is the nearby City Hall interchange, which is a 5-10min walk.  Check in was quick and easy and efficient and we were shown to our room without delay. Check out was the same, and all the regular staff were excellent and professional.",5,2,102,Pan Pacific Singapore,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294265-d302294-Reviews-Pan_Pacific_Singapore-Singapore.html,Singapore,6

Breakfast was ??7.50 with no charge for children - this was much better than I expected, plenty of good quality food in a clean and well serviced restaurant.

This used to be the 4 star Golden Tulip but changed hands about 6 months ago. The decor has been changed but there is no doubt that this hotel is above the normal standard set by Premier Inns. The staff were friendly throughout but special mention must be made of the check in staff and the quite outstandingly competent, friendly and efficient lady in charge of the restaurant, who apparently is a University student on a one year placement. Based on the experience with my group she has a good career in front of her.  The rooms were very good and again were above Premier Inn standard. The bedroom was spacious, the bathroom was spotless and everything worked perfectly.  The only downside was the quite outrageously expensive drink prices in the bar. A pint of Boddingtons is ??3.30 and a glass of wine over ??5.00 a glass. That is just a rip off.  That said the hotel is excellent and I would without doubt stay there again.  The price indicator on the TA site at over ??140 per night is way out of kilter. The price on weekdays is about ??69 and at the weekend it is ??82 for a room - I can&acute;t remember the exact prices but it is very close to that.",5,1,101,Premier Inn Manchester Old Trafford Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1020874-d209231-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Manchester_Old_Trafford_Hotel-Trafford_Greater_Manchester_England.html,Trafford,6

My two colleagues joined and we met with Liz in the lobby of our hotel and was greeted warmly before we embarked on a wonderful 4 hour exploration on foot. she does offer the option of tour via car but we preferred the intimacy of the streets. Liz is very knowledgeable of Montevideo and explained the history of that wonderful city very well at a good pace and gave access to some hidden gems which we would have simply walked past not knowing their part in the rich history of the city. She shared with the aid of old photos and posters how the city came about and the country&acute;s development as we wound way around the streets and historic buildings.

No buffet where food gets cold once you get to your table! My colleague has used the gym and she said it was great. The personnel is extremelly friendly and it seems quite frequent (maybe even standard?) that they greet you with a glass of champagne at check-in. I only have one suggestion for improvement: The day we left, it seems like a congress was also ending in Chicago. It was impossible to get a taxi and although the hotel was trying their best to put the staff to action to find taxis on different street corners, we waited more than 30 minutes.

The room itself was lovely, a good size by British standards (we had a luxury room) with the comfiest hotel bed I&acute;ve ever slept in. Quality bedding, bathrobes and toiletries, marble bathroom with bath and separate shower, everything was spot on really. The public areas were luxurious, the flowers smelt wonderful and the staff were always willing to help. Oh and the room even had an opening window too!  How civilised to come back to a turned down bed with classical music playing too....  Great location which managed to be fairly quiet but close to everywhere you wanted to go.

Can&acute;t fault the location as it is near to the harbour, luxurious harbour city, China Ferry Terminal (for outbound to Macau), MTR and small local shops.  All staff in the hotel were so polite. Especially impressed with housekeeping. What happened was that I left tips meant for the house-keeper onto a calling call. When I came back to the room, the tip was still there but the room nicely made up. I guessed its because the house-keeper thought I meant to give the tips to the house-keeper whose name was written on the calling card instead of her. Such honesty!  The only complaint I would have (but probably also my mistake) would be the pillows being too soft for my liking. I am not sure if they offer a choice of pillow selection, but I did not see any mention of being able to select choice. Otherwise, bed is comfy and bathroom comes with full set and ample supply of toiletries.  Also, breakfast was a nice spread of oriental and western. Fulfilling breakfast to keep you till lunch time.

Right from the security attendant to the front office manager they are the best Indian hospitality has to offer.  Yes, like the nearly 2000 reviews below , no doubt its the best property in Agra, overlooking the Taj and yes the pool is great and so is the dining especially Ephasan, but what truly sets this hotel apart is the care and hospitality EACH & EVERY team member offers you!  Just FYI WIFI is provided for just 30 mins a day for free and they rest needs to be purchased. The hotel also offers to arrange your tickets to the Taj Mahal at no extra cost and provides you with footwear too ( you are not allowed to walk in shoes at the Taj). They also have a private buggy that picks and drops you to the Taj Mahal again all this is complimentary! The hotels is less that 600 meters away from the monument and is the best place to stay, if even just for a night!   Given that we went off-season , front office manager Prachi promptly offered us an upgrade to a beautiful room with a balcony overlooking the Taj! we were so overwhelmed with that gesture itself that everything else they offered us only added up to how amazing they are and are truly nice people !  Sweenkriti and team helped us with a very quick check-in and when we asked about the specialty of the place, she and her colleague personally bought 3 huge boxes of India sweets (Peta) so we could experience the best Agra had to offer.  We knew they offer a complimentary yoga class, but had missed it at 3pm since we only made it to the hotel at 3.30 pm, when we inquired about it, Prachi immediately swung to action and got a personal class arranged for us ( we never asked her to, she just did it)  Rishab and Abhilash in the restaurants were such a fun group of people to talk to, always cheerful and vivacious, their personalities shone brighter than the sun. They made us try special desserts after dinner and went the extra mile to ask about our favorites. We realized they slept only 4 -5 hours since we had a late dinner and were up at 5 am to see the Taj, and they were there... all ready to offer us their best!  There are so many instances that i can&acute;t begin to illustrate how the team went above and beyond! Another member of the team found out about our lunch reservation the next day at India Accent in Delhi ( check out for separate review) and immediately bought it to my notice that his friend worked there and called him to ensure we get good service when we go there for lunch.

The queues are well-managed and the guides are courteous and friendly. The indoor experience here reminds me of a Disney World ride.... they take your photo with a cheesy backdrop for purchase later, they have sound and light effects in the elevator on the way up, and there&acute;s a gift shop upon exiting. Yep, very Disney-like. The experience on top, however, is not like Disney in that you can stay as long as you like and you can meander between the various observation floors. There is one deck that is fully enclosed with VERY clear glass and then the top floor with almost no obstructions of your view or photographs. I had read that the unobstructed view could be overly windy or cold, but we were there during this spring cold-snap, with brisk winds and temps in the upper-20&acute;s to mid-30&acute;s and we were still fine for this Southerner. We were able to truly get a gorgeous view of the surrounding city and the countryside beyond. We plan to return for a night view on our next trip to NYC in the fall.

This was dining at a completely different level from what most of us ever even dream about - and yet it was completely deicious and marvellous. We had booked for a special birthday, and were greeted on arrival by one of the (seemingly!) scores of staff who were around: escorted to the lounge where menus were presented, a bottle of champagne opened, and delicious canapes served. We ummed and ahed over the menu for a while, and then decided to go for the Menu Decouverte - a 10-course extravaganza at ??116 per head. Actually, this was outstanding value. Each of the courses was a work of art - precision in presentation, and sublime tastes. Nothing was hurried; service was friendly but professional; and we never had to ask for anything - everything just arrived as it was needed - more water, more bread, napkins refolded during meals. In addition, the dining-room is a lovely light airy space looking out onto the stunning grounds and gardens of the manor-house. Although it was very very busy when we were there, there was absolutely no sense of rush or hurry - we sat down at 1.30pm and got up for coffee at about 5.00pm. This place must be run like a military academy - it was fascinating just to watch the flawless service unfold and to sink into the sense of absolute luxury that pervades. Our bill for 5 came to ??900, incluing champagne, 2 bottles of wine, and tip. Some will flinch at this amount, but as I said - it is actually outstanding value for money. It isn&acute;t something that you would do often, and for many it may only be once-in-a life.

We didn&acute;t have the energy to do the Royal Mews and the gardens. However we did have enough to do the Terrace Tea Room, where we were served spectacular cakes and tea. But - a note of warning. Once you are inside, there is an awful lot of ground to cover, with very little seating to take a break. You can phone ahead for assistance, something we discovered at the end and something which my Mum, aged 86, would have found useful. This involves special access and leaves you less walking to do. There are no toliets until the end either - fortunately we had been warned about this beforehand, so had availed ourselves of the rather basic toilets at Green Park Tube station (which cost 50p to use!).

I was not disappointed.  This InterContinental is superior in every respect. It is well-located within a large office, convention and shopping complex, with easy access to numerous restaurants and a mall, which, while not beautiful, provided for every need I could possibly have. The Samsung metro stop is by the front door. My room was perhaps the largest I??™ve every stayed in, being at least twice the size of most hotel rooms, and containing all the latest electronics, amenities and comforts I could ever need. Perhaps most important was the friendly staff. I was a very frequent visitor to the concierge (I knew nothing about Seoul) and .every one of my questions were answered and requests fulfilled competently and with a smile. Oh, and the public areas of the hotel are beautiful. This InterContinental is a winner.

The outstanding, friendly staff and the spotlessly clean and fully refurbished property are a fantastic value. For me, the best reason to stay here was its close location to both the bus terminal and the subway. Being able to walk to Times Square is a big bonus if you are in tourist mode. I know others may have had problem with elevator wait times but I personally didn&acute;t. Free breakfast and afternoon cookies were a nice touch.

The balcony view is unparallelled. We dropped our bags and just sat outside for about an hour. The bed faced the sliding glass doors so you could watch the stars at night and the sun in the morning. A full size couch, table, desk and fridge/microwave were also part of the room. This was our first time in Virginia Beach and we look forward to coming back many more times. How good was the service and the room and the view....? Well, it prompted my husband to see if we could stay one more night and miss a day of work. Everyone, and I mean everyone was extremely hospitable--after we checked in, I realized I didn&acute;t have a bottle opener, so down to the front desk I went and I think her name was Honey(?) who worked in housekeeping found me a bottle opener to use.

It is just a block from the Finchley Road Tube Station, and the walk was an easy one. The lobby is really nice, with a lounge and breakfast area. The desk staff was courteous and efficient. The elevator was clean and we never had to wait long for it.  Our room was of typical size; we had twin beds with mattresses that were not the most comfortable we encoutered on our trip, but adequate. The cleaning staff did a good job on our room. There was a flat screen TV in the room, but we didn&acute;t watch much. It was our experience in all the hotels we visited that there are only a few channels, and we were there during election week and change in government, so that was about all there was to watch. The shower had good pressure and was easy to adjust.  Continental breakfast was handy; there was fresh brewed coffee available, and the baked goods were fresh. The milk in the dispenser was sour on the first morning, but that was taken care of quickly.  The hotel is across the street from the O2 Centre. There is a Wetherspoon&acute;s, an oriental restaurant and an Italian restaurant there. I had a good steak at Wetherspoon&acute;s, and the wait staff at the Italian restaurant was Italian and friendly. We enjoyed our meal there, too.  We used the internet service (extra charge) ; it is not wireless, but that didn&acute;t matter to our computer.  The public areas, stair wells and hallways were very clean.

My room, of more than adequate size, was long and narrow. It was furnished with fine woods and was decorated in an unmistakably Russian style. It wasn&acute;t elaborate or over-decorated, but the architectural detail differentiated this room from a standard 5-star hotel room (they look much the same to me).

There was a coffee maker and coffee/supplies in the room. Bathroom products were fab with a nice fresh scent - and replenished daily. King size bed was a dream - pillowtop mattress, loads of pillows and a feather comforter. Felt like I was falling into marshamallow fluff each night! You absolutely could not ask for a better located hotel.

Quite a few coffee shops and some fast food type places within steps of the hotel. Embarcadero center shopping (with all the standard chains) right up the street. Definitely go over to the farmers market at the Ferry building on Saturday if you are there. They also have Arts & Crafts booths each weekend right outside the hotel. It is such a breeze to have the ferry right across the street from the Hyatt, too. Just walk over and hop on to spend a day in Sausalito.

To be blunt, we didn&acute;t want to be there. Our friends insisted and treated us to dinner. They also ordered things we normally would avoid and force-fed us. Let me tell you, this was a GREAT thing. First off, you MUST have the Tuna Tartare. Yeah yeah - its raw and not your thing? Trust me, it&acute;s unbelievable. We tasted a bit just to be polite, then had to order one for ourselves because it&acute;s just that good. No fishiness at all, melt-in-your-mouth texture. I think this dish is reason enough to go there. After that we got some steaks and mushrooms, and I think we got every side available to share with the group. After one bite of that dinner, we forgot about our sucky day and had a great time. The server was attentive, classy and amusing. The food was outstanding. No wonder this place has the reputation they do.

It is not just Impressionist paintings, though there are some on the 5th floor, but there are also sculptures and other types of paintings. There is a reason that this has some of the longest lines to get into. Don&acute;t let that deter you though. I just got back today and have a big tip. The TRICK to getting in there involves going to the little souvenir kiosk to the right of the main entrance area. You can buy tickets there for the SAME PRICE as regular admission and get to skip the line! You go in the right side entrance for museum pass holders and advance ticket holders. The left sided line for purchasing tickets was insane. Learned this from an Australian couple while taking another tour and it proved right. To find it, you can walk down the Metro steps and come up the ramp on the other side and it&acute;s right in front of you or just stand and face the entry and gawk at the length of the line and then turn 90 degrees to the right and see the souvenir kiosk right there and he has a sign hanging from near the register that states that he sells the tickets.

What made it so good, aside from the inherent qualities of an historic, famous and unique vessel, and the glimpse it provides into a privileged existence that we can only imagine, was the way the charitable trust that owns and operates what is now a museum, has put the whole thing together. The flow of traffic through the vessel is creative and the signage is clear and unobtrusive. The audio guides are not only informative and very interesting, but the electronics worked flawlessly. A full-time maintenance staff of 13 keeps the ship in top-notch shape, as if the royal family were about to board.

The staff were professional and personable, the service what you&acute;d expect from a high quality establishment, the decor throughout the hotel top notch. They also appointed the bathrooms very well with plush towels, robes and even thought to include Q-tips and a nail file.  The only way it could have been better is if the in-room internet access were free. Well, that and the fact that getting to the tower suites is rather a trek through this giant hotel block. Several other guests got lost and decidedly irritated. The suites, however, are far enough off the strip and out of the way of the casino that the rooms are blissfully quiet.

22450,ClarkCreek,Hotels,7/4/2014,Nice location within walking distance to downtown.,"We stayed here on HHonors points because we wanted to stay in a hotel where we could walk downtown day or night. The state capital building was also within easy walking distance. The hotel made an excellent base to explore and was a high quality hotel, with a very large and clean room, nice check-in area, friendly staff, good business center (2 computers), and a nice eating area. Breakfast and the evening reception had very good selection and were well-maintained by the hostesses. The macaroni and cheese for supper was very good! We had a nice view toward downtown from our room. It was a little difficult upon arriving to the hotel since there wasn&acute;t any place to park and unload our luggage; we finally parked in near the bell stand area 1/2 a block away from the entrance. When we left the hotel, I had to pick the car up from the garage (several blocks away) and stop in the pay parking lot across the street and the others in the party walked the luggage across the street. One other small issue, which probably couldn&acute;t be avoided, is that the elevators and area around them had no security and weren&acute;t near the check-in desk; I did notice a camera pointing at the elevators and there was a secure door to get to the individual rooms. Although downtown was close, there was a small park a block away where it appeared homeless people stayed during the day and there was always a police car parked next to it during the day with two policemen. We walked on the opposite side of the street and felt safe.

Heathrow Connect from LHR took 25 mins and then a 3-min walk from the station. Believe we got a slight upgrade to bigger rooms - they were fresh, inviting and comfortable. Nice bath amenities as well. Having seen our fair share of 4 or 4+ star hotels in London, this was really welcome. For us, it was a great combination/mix - a place you&acute;d look fwd to coming back to after a long day sightseeing, with comfy rooms, easy access to the Tube/bus, and 24-hr convenience and restaurants/bars next door. (ie, we didn&acute;t care that there was no cavernous lobby with chandeliers, porters, conf rooms, and facilities we&acute;d never use, etc) For us, this made more sense, with a small but helpful front desk (Francesca & team were great!).  Some improvement tips: a few in our group did try breakfast, which was apparently nothing to write home about (not helped by the fact that someone was mopping the floor while they ate). Also, in the spirit of minimalism, I didn&acute;t mind running down to the bar for ice, but they never had any available (!). Finally - and this is probably more a IHG corporate policy - when we paid the balance of our booking, the amount had been converted from UK pounds, but with a hefty 3-4% extra. We should&acute;ve been given the option of paying in pounds.  But all in all, a very pleasant stay, a great base and perhaps most of all, the right"""" mix of services and comfort-level that we&acute;d want to pay for.

The NJV Athens Plaza may not be as grand and prestigious as the Grand Bretagne, judging by the well-heeled clientele that moved in and out of Grand Bretagne. However, NJV Athens is still one of the top dogs in this row. The hotel appears to be well-established with staff being mature and hospitable but not as crisp and dynamic as the Hyatt or Marriott. I guess it is more of a traditional homely feel within a old 5* establishment.  Here&acute;s what counts: the rooms are quite spacious but the beds are too SOFT....I dread if I were to be over 100 kgs. And there was no kettle in the room with complimentary coffee/tea...surprising for a Euro 160 a night room. There is a fridge/minibar but no complimentary water either. Otherwise, the room had an old feel and being a low storey hotel, you often hear the street noise and traffic quite easily. There is a balcony that gives you a small clip view of Acropolis but nothing to shout about. Have to keep the curtains shut as the opposite building is very close.

This property, the Sheraton Skyline, while enormous and a bit confusing in layout, has a well groomed, and sophisticated feel. I had a great sleep in a newly renovated and quiet room. Staff were top notch and there&acute;s a Starbucks in the lobby and a nice brekkie buffet that starts early. I loved the indoor courtyard pool and snazzy tropical bar and seating area - a great place to wind down, it feels very far away from the hustle bustle of Heathrow. There&acute;s an airport shuttle to the door, its surprisingly expensive for a very short ride - Im used to free airport shuttles in the US and Canada. At least, tickets are easy to buy at a kiosk near the front desk and the bus runs like clockwork. I would have appreciated the option to upgrade to the Club Floor - but this wasn&acute;t available during my stay - reasons were not very clear. Despite a lobby full of air crew members check in was a breeze.

My room was beautiful and looked right on to Times Square and I could see the Empire State building as well which was incredible.( Unfortunately I was right next door to the cleaners rooms who were very noisy early in the morning but once they had finished calling out to each other and cleaning all the rooms it was very quiet.) I did request to move but they forgot about it so I just stayed put as it was a very comfortable room other than the early morning noise and I felt very safe in this room, travelling on my own to this incredible city all the way from Australia, was very important to me, they also forgot about my birthday, which was very upsetting, as I had thought someone would have just wished me a Happy Birthday, but unfortunately there were no little niceities like that or friendliness at the Hotel, there was only one staff member who actually said hello to me during my eight day stay. There were a few other little incidents which were very upsetting but on the whole I would still be happy to recommend this hotel to any one thinking of staying there though as you cannot beat the location, straight out the door and Times Square is right there. It is safe and clean and comfortable and a very nice Hotel. Coming from Australia I had never experienced such cold weather, 2 degrees is unheard of in Australia, and after a day out and about I was so happy to get back to the warmth in the Crowne Plaza and back to my beautiful room and just sit and watch the lights on the Empire State Building. I was also lucky enough to be on the Conceirge level which had a lovely lounge area with beautiful views also, it just would have been so nice if the staff had been a little friendlier and kinder to someone who was on their own or to anyone really, it dosnt hurt to ask how was you day or how are you today, or Welcome to the Hotel and of coarse a Happy Birthday would have been so lovely and meant so much, still it was not done on purpose I know how busy they are and they do have excellent Management at the Hotel, if it could just be passed on to the staff who are actually at the Hotel, then it would be a first class Hotel. I do hope to return again with my family. I also wanted to recommend the Addams Family on Broadway it is the most wonderful show with Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth and if you are wondering what show to see this is definately the one and you can purchase your tickets from the Theatre itself, something I didnt realise at the time. After I left New York I went to Hawaii for 14 nights and experienced the best hospitality and when I arrived there was a most beautiful belated birthday/welcome basket left in my room from the Hotel Manager and I was so grateful that my birthday was acknowledged even though it was a few days later, it still meant the world to me.

The checkout has its own line you so there isn&acute;t a long wait and you can also do the express check out in a mail drop box if your realy pressed for time. Main Venetian pool doesn&acute;t get any sun until early afternoon (at least 2pm), the second pool had some sun shortly after noon but you can use the Palazzo pool that has sun around 9 am.  ----------  After 10 years of being open, it still looks very clean and nice...the only hotel that looked nicer was the Wynn but that one was just recently built.  Our Room on the 24 floor was the basic suite and it was plenty big for 2 people with a large bathroom (tv and great complimentary bathroom products), king bed (with a second tv) and spacious sitting area with a couch and a third tv.  Automatic blinds were handy, the bed was very comfy, the bath robes came in handy and overall our room was very quiet...no real late night noise but we stayed Sun-thurs.  Although some might find it a little bothersome, I liked the fact that you had to show your room card to security to access the elevators to your room at the elevator ground floor...this kept out people that shouldn&acute;t be there.  The hotel itself is at the north most of the south strip which makes it a little less busy then say Caesars Palace which is just about a 10 minute walk south.  there is a good Asian noodle restaurant we tried on the mainfloor in the casino area and the upstair&acute;s food court is great for inexpensive breakfast or lunch...there are also a few much nicer restaurants that we didn&acute;t try but they seemed really nice. You also have a Walgreens just outside the Hotel which can come in handy.

The rooms were proven to be upgraded from many years of use but that&acute;s to be expected from a hotel that&acute;s been there for years.  The shuttle is great as well. It leaves before the park opens and then departs every 30 minutes after until about an hour after the park closes. It does this when picking you up at the resort as well. The drivers are very nice and helpful. If you have a stroller, they will store it in the rear (all they ask is for you to collapse it, if possible). It beats having to drive there each time.

The reason I now stay in this part of town is because of the outstanding location that is is.  The Best Western Victoria Palace is in two separate buildings. I stayed in The Annex which was the Brindle Hotel purchased by Best Western a year ago or so. Whilst the rooms are on the smaller side (and much smaller than the main building), they are spotless and have TV, deposit box, tea/coffee and an immaculate en-suite bathroom.  Whilst I will agree with some other reviews that the towels are quite thin and the mattress a bit hard, I would like to remind these people that you do not get much in London for 60 Pounds.  Having stayed and/or seen numerous hotel in Pimlico/Victoria, the Best Western Victoria Palace offers by far the best value. Worth noting the service was excellent and a porter carried the luggage to my room.

12594,Beaches2626,Hotels,1/6/2012,"Cheap, Easy, Enjoyable Vaca","We stayed at the Magna Casa for 5 nights at the end of Dec 2011 on points. The airport transfer was cheap and fairly painless we did have to wait for about 15-20 min for a couple with children to claim all their baggage before we left. The hotel was completely booked so I was surprised when we as Elite Members were upgraded from a standard to an ocean view room. We arrived at 1245 and were made to wait until 3pm for our room to be ready. So we changed into bathing suits in the bathroom and headed to the pool restaurant.  The service was all around slow but very pleasant and friendly- the slow speed could have been contributed to a fully booked hotel and the holiday season. The food was pretty disappointing with the exception of the Italian rest at the JW Marriott. The steakhouse was nothing special and the TexMex place in the JW was far from great. I actually made the poor waiter get me chips and salsa half way through the meal to make my own nachos because the flour tortillas were just so chalky and dense. The Italian place in the JW next door had amazing food !! Truly great service I wish I would have known because we would have eaten there every night of the week.  Our room was decent. The bed was the typical Marriott big comfy bed and everything was very clean. Our ocean view room, was not ocean view if we had paid for that view I would have been pissed. You had to stand on the far side of the balcony to view the ocean. From the bed or looking straight out all you could see was into other guestrooms in the JW across the way. You could clearly see exactly what was going on in the beds across the way.  Now my biggest complaint and the only real issue with this property, the shower ! OMG this thing is my arch enemy. It had this little steel knob that needed to be pulled up to make the water come out the shower head instead of the bath. So my husband and I spent a good 10 minutes pulling and twisting this thing every which way but unless you physically held it up it just kept falling back down. So maintenance came up and showed us that it needed to be pulled very softly until you left a little catch, then sometimes it stayed. Well if you turn the water hotter or colder, or look at this thing wrong it fell back down. I counted anywhere between 7-12 times during one shower I had to stop and try to pull it back up just the right way to get the water to start again. It was the most annoying thing EVER ! Another night before dinner no matter what I did I couldn??™t get it to catch and I had to have maintenance come back up to my room. Needless to say I was late for dinner. The bathroom in general is outdated with pink marble and very old fixtures. MARRIOTT FIX YOUR SHOWERS !  The pool area was decent, pretty small pool for the amount of rooms but the hot tub is HUGE! The service around the pool and on the beach is good, taco stand right there is nice. I found the prices pretty cheap everywhere on the property. With a fully booked hotel I wokeup everyday at 7am to get a beach chair, if you wokeup at 9 you weren??™t getting one by the beach or pool. I found it annoying that the towel stand didn??™t open until 8 or later sometimes, so guests were actually grabbing dirty towels out of the bin from the day before, this was a common occurrence??¦ ewwwww. Throughout the day the hotel ran out of the towels and I was often told to come back in 30 minutes.  Beach is clean and the water is beautiful- highly recommend the wave runners right infront of the hotel. We also strongly recommend Xplor tour ??“ it was an entire day of soooo much fun from ziplining, to underground cave swims, raftin, and gator off-roadin. If you can just pay at the gate- the shuttle from the hotel to the bus parking lot to the actual park was long and annoying.",4,5,105,CasaMagna Marriott Cancun,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d219145-Reviews-CasaMagna_Marriott_Cancun-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,Cancun,3

The hotel is spotless, the staff is outstanding, the rooms are wonderful. Special mention must be made to Elaine Tyndall and the ever popular Linda in the breakfast area. The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars, is due to the breakfast. Perhaps a slight improvement is needed (choices). If I may add one more thing - we were in a suite.

It simply couldnt be closer to times square whilst still allowing you to sleep. Central park is 10 mins walk, rockerfella 5 mins walk broadway all around you, etc, etc. The hotel is also VERY busy with relentless streams of people when we were there.  Our room unfortunately didnt have a view of times square but still had a view to the hudson river all the same. Our room was reasonably tight in size but very modern throughout.  One reason we selected this hotel was because it had a gym and pool. The gym is great although undergoing some improvements. The pool however is currently closed for refurbishment which was very frustrating. The other irritations were that it costs $10 per person to use EXCEPT if you join the crowne plaza club for free!

My wife&acute;s luggage was stuck in Vienna and the hotel staff had it delivered to our room the day after we arrived. Service was ok, nothing spectacular.  Our biggest complaint was that the hotel was on the Guidecca Island and we had to constantly wait on the shuttle boat. Make sure to keep a schedule with you at all times and plan your trips around the shuttle boat, there is no way to get to the hotel without hiring a private boat. We were stuck in St. Mark&acute;s Square for nearly 1 1/2 hours waiting while the boat took a break, very cold in November I might add...

I agree the rooms are very small, but everything is so clean and the location is amazing, the size of the rooms does not really matter. You are in NYC, it&acute;s not like you&acute;re spending the whole day in your room. The hotel is close to Times Square and also a 10 minutes walk to Grand Central Station where you can take the metro to explore NYC.  The complimentary breakfast was a nice bonus. You had a choice between cooked things (eggs, bacon, toast, etc) and cold stuff (cereals, fruit, yoghurt, ...). There is not much space in the breakfastarea, but in the whole 10 days there was not a single day we really had to wait before we could sit down. You have to eat on carton plates and the knifes and forks were plastic, but that didn&acute;t really bother me.  The complimentary wireless internet came in very handy and worked well. There is also a small business center with two computers where you can also print out documents for free.  Overall I would certainly recommend this hotel.

30068,ElizabethDawn,Hotels,7/7/2010,Perfect Location!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Holiday Inn from June 19-23. We had a one bedroom suite on the 16th floor.  The room was quite large by New York standards. The bedroom had a king-size bed with a flat screen tv, while the living room had a pull-out couch with another flat screen tv. There was also a small fidge and a microwave in the room, as well. Bathroom was small-ish, but worked just fine for us. The room was always very clean and well appointed with creams, soaps, shampoo, etc. Always plenty of fresh towels.  We found the service was excellent at the hotel. From the front desk staff to the bell boys, everyone was always smiling and willing to help point us in the right direction. The free breakfast was nice too, as there was always eggs, sausage, toast, cereals, etc. The eating area was pretty small, so we just grabbed a tray and ate our breakfast in our room every morning... no big deal.  The location can&acute;t be beat. You&acute;re a stones throw away from Times Sqaure (about 5 min walk), Fifth Ave shopping, Central Park (10 min), and all the major bus/ subway routes. There are lots of places to eat all around the hotel, so finding a meal was never an issue. We only had to take a cab twice for our entire stay.  Let&acute;s be real: while in NYC, the only time you&acute;re really in the room is in the mornings and at night before bed. This hotel is a great base for daily adventures around the city. There aren&acute;t a lot of fancy frills, but it is more than adequate for a standard visit to NYC.  If you&acute;re considering going to the Big Apple and need a clean, friendly place to stay at decent rates, I would definitely recommend checking out the HIE 5th Ave.",4,1,101,Holiday Inn Express New York City Fifth Ave,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d584986-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_New_York_City_Fifth_Ave-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,3

Since this was our visit to New York, we stayed in on of their rooms on the top 5 floors, facing Empire State building. The view was okay, but I could have honestly skipped it and saved the money. However, the big advantage about being that high was you couldn&acute;t here any of the sirens or street noise, so that was a plus!  The room size was smaller than usual (in terms of room size in other cities) but it was adequate for our stay in Manhattan. It was clean and the service staff was great. The two elevators are quite slow at times. Luckily we didn&acute;t go in and out a lot so the wait wasn&acute;t all that bad. The air condionning in our room worked great, which was key because it was over 100 degrees during the day with the humidity. We slept great!  The best part was the location. We walked to Time Square a couple of times (there and back) without any problems.

(Didn&acute;t eat there any other meals but assume it would be just as good). 4. Decent amenities: flat screen TV, mini frig, Bose radio. 5. Bedding was comfortable! (But bed itself wasn&acute;t if more than one person in a double).  Cons 1. Double beds dipped in the middle so don&acute;t plan on sharing as it&acute;s very uncomfortable. My room was big enough to fit 2 queen beds. This Marriott should upgrade! 2. Bathroom was large but the shower was way too small. 3. They charge for everything: $9.95+ and up per day for Internet; $56 per day for parking as I recall...both probably typical for this area but still expensive when you are paying $500 per night for the room. 4.

20801,CheersTC,Hotels,9/27/2011,Comfortable hotel & great base for Thomas Land,"From the very moment we arrived right up to the minute we left the hotel staff couldn??™t do enough for us. We stayed here as a family (2 adults, 2 children) for 3 nights and used the hotel as a base for Thomas Land.  Check in was very pleasant, helpful and informative. Our room was a family room on the ground floor located close to the restaurant and bar which was great for breakfast \ dinner. The room itself consisted of a very comfortable double bed and two single beds. The bathroom was well stocked with the usual toiletries and looked to have been only done up recently. The only comment I would make in relation to the room is that it was a tad bit on the tight size but this didn??™t bother us too much.  We ate each night in the hotel. Once in Hathaways Bar and twice in the Adderley restaurant. Both had adequate menus including a decent choice of kid??™s meals. We experienced no issues with the kids themselves being in the pub or restaurant which is what you really want as a family when you??™re away. Our favourite was the Adderley restaurant and the food, service was great. Breakfast was included in our stay and again no complaints. There were plenty of healthy options and also no shortage of hot food. A great way to start the day considering we would be walking around Thomas Land all day. There is a swimming pool on site and we used it twice during our stay. It is small but adequate and towels where provided. The pool closes to guests in the evening sometime around 6pm so bear that in mind if you promise to take them swimming after Thomas Land.  Overall we had a very relaxing time, the hotel was a great base for Thomas Land and the kids enjoyed their stay here so we enjoyed it.

The hotel is nesteled in a hip, neat area of London. It has great access to the DLR and the Tube. There are counteless pubs and nice cafes to sip, drink and be merry.  When, I arrived, the front desk, check-in experience was professional and seamless. The agent offered to help and even escorted me to the elevator. The room was spacious, clean and modern. For London, it was a great value. I had a view of the canal, even though I was on the 1st floor. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was roomy and had a great surger of water from the shower head. They offered a great in-room selection of tea&acute;s and coffee. There was a safe and a desk area to work. I didn&acute;t eat at the hotel, so I can&acute;t comment. I did use the gym, which had great equipement and was open 24 hours.  The only negative that I could say was that internet was a charge item. Of course, it is an industry standard to charge so I wouldn&acute;t let that deter me from staying. The Bellman and concierge went out of their ways to give me directions. US Airways lost my luggage, so I had to do some quick shopping. There are some great areas to purchase any type of clothing. Most America&acute;s would love this place.London is on the more expensive side due to our weak dollar. You will get your money&acute;s worth during this stay.  The hotel is closer to Gatwick Airport and London city airports. Heathrow is a longer journey, but very doable. I took the Underground Picadilly to the Jublie line and got off at Canary Wharf. It was about a $12.00 ride. You have to be able to climb stairs with your suitcases. You can always take the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station and the tube or a taxi, which will range from $36.00 to around $85.00. A taxi or car service will be well above $100.00 USD. Access to the rest of London is easy on the Tube or DLR near the hotel. You can be at all the sights with a brief tube journey 20 minutes at the most.

It has your basic amenities like Valet, Bell boys for luggage, casino, nightclub (don&acute;t recomend-see my LAX review), food court and other attractions. This hotel is also joined with the Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur. You don&acute;t have to go outSide to get to these either.  I stayed in a stqueen delux room which had two queen size beds. They were really comfortable. Unfortunatly there was no refrigerator in the room and it was a $10 a day charge to get one. There was also no lock box, these were available downstairs.

The food has always been good and consistent with their other locations...however; the service differs from time to time.  Unfortunately, the Imperial Valley is cursed with downgraded service. On a few visits, shortly after opening, the staff was very cheerful and would check your table frequently.  My last few visits showed lesser level of costumer service. I had to chase down a waiter (not even ours) to ask for refills, I was craving a dessert and waited about 20 mins for the waiter. When she arrived, she attempted to just sneak and leave the receipt on the table. I had her take it and add the dessert I wanted. The tip I left showed my disappointment with the service.

We had such a great time - I can&acute;t understand what all the complaints are about!? It all started at check-in: Bernie was awesome and gave us a free upgrade to a fountain view room on the 23rd floor. Absolutely stunning views. We were able to watch the Bellagio fountains right from our room every night. We had a standard 2 queen bed room, which was a little on the dark side, but totally fine. No complaints, except that a fridge would have been nice. Big bathroom with separate tub & shower and lots of room for 2 girls to get ready. Maid service was great. This hotel is literally in the middle of everything. Paris hotel is next door, Bellagio & Caesar&acute;s across the street -- couldn&acute;t ask for more! Loved the location and the Miracle Mile shops attached to the casino. Lots of options for food & drinks -- make sure you try Gordon Ramsay&acute;s BurGR restaurant, it was amazing! Yolo&acute;s Drunken Nachos were also a hit! The casino has a young, cool vibe, which we really enjoyed. Loved coming back from a night out at the clubs to hear the music blasting and everyone having a great time. Really makes it feel like Vegas. It&acute;s a bit smoky, but so is every other casino on the strip, so it&acute;s something you just have to get used to. We had Britney Spears tickets and loved the show -- felt like we were teenagers again! She plays at the Axis Theatre in PH, so it was super convenient and easy to get to. All said and done, I give this property 4 stars. Great service at the front desk, everything was clean & well-kept, and the location can&acute;t be beat. In-room fridges and more wardrobe space would definitely help make it that much better, but for goodness sake people - you&acute;re in Vegas!

25171,DallasChris,Hotels,7/2/2015,"Nice hotel and rooms, but some aspects need severe updating","I recently stayed at this hotel for 7 nights for a conference. It is a beautiful hotel on the outside, and in the lobby and second floors. The lobby is great with fountains everywhere. My son lost his hat in a fountain and the staff quickly found and returned it to our room. We had multiple issues with our door locks, but the staff made up for it with free breakfast buffet (which was awesome) and free spg points.  The rooms were updated and very nicely appointed. We had adjoining rooms with our family and it was no inconvenience. The elevators are great that open out to the atrium and then outdoors. Beyond all of that, we found out that the hotel has been feautred in at least 9 Hollywood films! They&acute;re all displayed in the hallway on the way to the garage. Parking is prohibitively expensive though, it is valet only and $47 per night! But we had the best welcome staff who gave us a discount since we were staying so many nights.  I have a couple of gripes about the hotel though. The 2nd and 4th floors are not accessable using the regular elevators, only the service elevators. This was a major hassle for my party as we had a stroller and couldn&acute;t go up and down a flight of stairs. Also, I&acute;m sure that there are handicapped guests who don&acute;t appreciate being treated like cargo to reach these floors. Floors 3-5 are terrible! They are extremely outdated, for example the 1994 film True Lies used these elevators. The scenery from the 3-5 floors is exactly as it was in the film over 20 years ago! Some may find this nostalgic, I found it off-putting. Don&acute;t for any reason think you will eat on the 4th floor &acute;food court&acute;. It is a very run down group of sickly looking restaurants. I went there and did not want anything I saw. I am glad they used their capital expenditures on the rooms, but it may be time to update the elevators and 3-5 floors.

The hotel is located approx 15 Km to the west of Paris. As other reviewer has mentioned, there is a bus stop right outside of the hotel - bus no 258 that takes you to the terminal station of line 1 - La Defense. The bus route cost Euro 1.80 and it takes about 30 mins. Bus interval is between 20 to 30 mins depends time of day.  From La defense, line 1 will take you to major attraction like the Louvre Museum and it costs Euro 1.70. Someone told me that it is better to buy a 1 day pass but i didnt find that option on the automatic ticketing machine but you can try the ticketing booth.  Tips on the ticketing machine - the option for language is buried in the second page after you selected an option from the first page. Try your luck and you be fine. You only need a ticket to get in and then exit from station doesnt require a ticket. On the metro, the door doesnt open automatically and you either have to press a green button or rotate a lever. Dont pull on the door handle otherwise the door wont open - I learned that by hard experience!  Back to the hotel, it is ok. And there is plenty of couches in the lobby area to use free wifi. Hotel facilities are on par with the price paid as we saw it costed around US$100 per night per room during the winter season - maybe a little more during the summer season,.

11133,BMWilliams1982,Restaurants,10/28/2011,"Great Value, great food and great location","The Potted Pig is a welcome new treat to Cardiff, mainly in my opinion because of its location. So many of the better restaurants in Cardiff are found in the suburbs (probably because of extortionate rates that only the major chains can afford) so to have this place open up in town is great.  The setting is interesting, deep down in the caverns of a former bank vault. You are greeted by a very friendly chap on the door at street level who takes you down, takes your coats and leaves you with an equally friendly waitress/waiter. This may seem trivial but its these little touches that make a good restaurant great.  They have done well with the menu, not only with the local ingredients on offer and the variety of food but also the size of the menu. Small enough to choose, big enough to have choice! That said the gin menu was astonishing - I have never seen so many on offer! I think they must have a thing for gin here.  The food was very well cooked, wholesome and unpretentious but still beyond most ordinary chefs. The only slight let down was the porter house steak which one of our party had - very expensive and could have been more outstanding for the money. All our other meals though were lovely with particular praise heaped on the Cassoulet and the starter of Cod Cheeks and Cockles on Toast - very good.  The atmosphere was great, it works for groups and couples alike. I would like to go with a group of 8 as that qualifies you to have the whole suckling pig! The staff were really friendly and attentive and the bill was very reasonable. We all had 3 courses, loads of wine and other drinks and still kept it under ??40 per head.

15758,Bouff,Restaurants,7/10/2013,A Good Choice,We wanted to have a meal with friends after a late afternoon event at O2. Initially we booked a venue within the O2 complex. However some research led me to this establishment one tube stop on. As it turned out this was the first really hot day of summer and at Amerigo Vespucci we were able to eat outdoors. The Menu was not huge but perfectly adequate. As we decided to eat outdoors I suspect that we did not get to appreciate the ambience of the restuarant which looked very nice inside. Our only disappointment was that a tablecloth was not laid on our outside table. Others dining outdoors did but we were quite late sitting down and maybe that is why. I would certainly eat here again if in the Canary Wharf area.,4,0,100,Amerigo Vespucci,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d731523-Reviews-Amerigo_Vespucci-London_England.html,London,6

12013,Barbara48,Hotels,10/11/2010,Always a good stay,"I have stayed at this hotel for the last 8 years when i come to Paris. I have always thought it a good value for money. They have a friendly, helpful staff. That being said I would not go to them for restaurant reservations. I always come with my own list and they graciously make the reservations for me when I email them and confirm them when i arrive. This year when we left for the airport it was raining and fashion week so they had to really work to get us a taxi . However, they came through for us. It is things like this that make me a repeat client. Even my husband, the hotel snob, thought this was a great place.",4,2,102,Au Manoir Saint Germain De Pres,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d207574-Reviews-Au_Manoir_Saint_Germain_De_Pres-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,Paris,6
13784,Bijouxmama,Hotels,3/30/2011,Best Location in Town!,"I was very nervous about my travel to Paris since I had never travelled to Europe and didn&acute;t know what to expect. But not only did I fall in love with Paris this hotel was the perfect location for everything I wanted to do. It was in the heart of St. Germain, steps from a taxi stand and metro station. I walked EVERYWHERE! I was amazed by the amount of cafe&acute;s and shops so close to the hotel. The hotel was very nice and clean. Breakfast was limited in selection but very good and fresh. The front desk staff was super nice (especially the Portugese woman who works during the day. Our biggest compalint about the room is the heating and air. Our A/C was not turned on, I suppose because it&acute;s not usually 70 degrees in March. But... since our room was so hot we had to sleep with the window open and someone on the ground starts banging on trash cans at 5am. After a few nights I just started taking sleeping pills then I could get some sleep. At the end of the day I really liked the hotel and I would stay there again :)",4,1,101,Au Manoir Saint Germain De Pres,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d207574-Reviews-Au_Manoir_Saint_Germain_De_Pres-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,Paris,6
22530,ClemFR,Hotels,2/7/2009,Pleasant stay at the Berjaya in Jan 2009,"My partner and I stayed at the Berjaya for 10 nights in a chalet on water, and came back a few days ago. My partner found it difficult to sleep at times, when the tide was coming up as the water crashes on the rocks. However, that was easily resolved with some sleep on the beach during the day!  The day we left home, I read the latest reviews on Tripadvisor and they were awful, so I was upset. Now I can say that the bad reviews on Tripadvisor all seem to refer to people who booked jungle chalets. We went to one of them randomly and it was less nice than our water chalet indeed ??“ so I understand some of the reviews. The advice here is: save up more (or stay fewer nights overall) and book a new chalet = the water ones (or very close to the seafront). They are more expensive but at least you get peace of mind. The water chalets come with little extras such as separate shower from the bath, bathrobes, a safe, complementary bottled water, balcony facing the sea, bright room (trees in the jungle make the jungle chalets very dark inside), less bugs (just some ants at night but you can plug in a device that put them off), ??¦ You can see a resort map on Berjaya Resorts website, very useful - check prices on their site directly too, they have some offers at times. Some reviewers state that they didn??™t like the monkeys/animals around??¦ Well, if you don??™t want them around in their natural habitat, you should not choose a resort right at the edge of a 5 million year old jungle in the first place!  We stayed during the period of Chinese New Year ??“ we live in China and the country shuts down for a week, so we went abroad for a break. The resort was a bit busy that week, but the 1 day before and the 2 days after were quiet. Because the resort is comprised of 500 chalets/rooms, with 2 to 3 people per room, avoid peak periods. The guests are split between two restaurants for breakfast to spread the crowd. If you stay at a Jungle chalet, chances are you will be asked to go to the lobby restaurant (Dayang) -and have to pay for it. If you stay at a chalet on Water, you will be directed to the Beach restaurant -and it is included. The choice changes a little bit every day and overall, you can get a decent breakfast including fresh juice (ask for it), tea/coffee, freshly cut fruits, various types of bread, waffles, eggs cooked to your liking, Asian hot dishes (such as chicken curry and nasi lemak), cheeses, salads, cereal, etc. No idea how much it costs as it was included for people staying in water chalets.  We pre-organised Berjaya to pick us up at the airport, it costs 15 Ringgits (MR) per person. By taxi, it is 24MR in total. Note that in Malaysia, most taxi rides have pre-defined costs and for example, at airports, they have taxi counters where you pay the fixed fee before getting into a cab. No driver will drive you around and waste time. Good stuff. Check-in was smooth. We were welcomed by Joyce. We had a welcome drink while she was doing a bit of admin, then we all hopped on a shuttle to our water chalet. She showed us around in the room, very clearly. Her dynamism and kindness were pleasant to us, as a first impression. We liked the view, but the chalet (to my surprise) was not decorated in any exotic way. Nevermind, it was bright, clean and quiet. Our bed was 2 beds together, no big deal, but the mattresses were not too comfortable to us and the edges too hard. Nothing major though, could sleep OK!  There are 2 bars and 4 restaurants: lobby bar, pool bar, then the main restaurant under the lobby called Dayang serving Chinese and Malay food (did not try it), a separate Chinese restaurant (did not try it). Then the 2 restaurants we used are the ones I will talk about. They were the Beach one (serving Western, Malay and Indian food ??“ menus differ from lunch to dinner) and the Thai one (at the end of a pier, for dinner only). Those 2 restaurants were serving good food and the staff was very attentive, polite, smiley. At the Beach restaurant, burger and chips costs 19MR, prawn-avocado salad 20RM, lamb-mango salad 22MR, pizza 20MR (6 inches)/ 32MR (9 inches), pasta MR35-40. Evening main dishes include chicken curries with poppadoms, small dhall and pilau rice for around 50MR (add 10 MR for garlic naan), and Australian tenderloin for around 60MR ??“ this dish is served with a very small amount of vegetables; maybe have a side of chips on top. The Thai restaurant is at the end of a pier and the food is very tasty. Dinner with 2 starters, 2 mains + rice to share and a bottle of wine will cost you around 250MR.  On the contrary of what I read on a recent review, they do serve you on the beach. Two members of staff arrive at 12 and stay until 5 at their little beach stand, where you can order food and drinks that are then served at your sun bed. Also, right at the entrance of the beach, the Fruit Stall is open from 12 to 6, and they prepare fresh fruits to order, priced by weight. For example, 100g of watermelon is 2.5MR (50 British pence). The prices at the Berjaya are inclusive of service tax (10% across the country) and because of Langkawi status, no Government tax (normally at 5%) applies. I would say that food & drinks at Berjaya overall are not cheap, it is quite close to UK prices. 250MR is 50GBP. But we went to check 2 other restaurants in other resorts (at Mutiara and at Casa del Mar) and the prices were higher. We didn??™t eat at the Mutiara (next door resort), but tried Casa del Mar on Cenang (=Chenang) beach. The setting is lovely, right on the soft sand and under palm trees. Do go there for a treat. Call in the morning to book or the best tables will be gone. The prawn starter (6 massive prawns on skewers) was amazing, at 29MR + 10% service charge. The main courses are a bit on the nouvelle cuisine side, so maybe a side dish also. Finally, about the 2 restaurants at Berjaya, both have live entertainment, just a guitar and a singer, pleasant, not annoying at all like some reviews said. The live band in the lobby who plays from 9.30pm until 1am is louder and play some famous tunes, so if you are in a bit of a party mood, that??™s quite fun.  About Mutiara: I have to say that the resort looked tired, depressing and they have no beach. The guests overlooking the Berjaya next door must have felt jealous at the nice resort with a private beach. About Cenang (=Chenang ??“ no need to repeat, save space) ??“ we only went there once for dinner at Casa del Mar, and we were so glad we didn??™t book a hotel on Cenang! It is crowded, noisy and mostly, not neat. If you are a 25 year old baba-cool guy, that??™s your kind of place. But the exact location of Casa del Mar is away from the cool area, so it was OK. They only have 34 rooms and I would say no privacy, as they are all in a massive 2 storey house; we much prefer the individual chalets with no shared wall with other guests. Matter of taste.  At Berjaya, you are given beach towels for the day. Go to the little hut by the pool to pick them up. The pool area was pretty but so busy. If you want to relax and doze off, don??™t go there. The music can be a bit loud as well. We noticed that most families, and Chinese groups, stayed around the pool area, which made it crowded and noisy, so we avoided it. On the beach, people really want to relax so there is no loud talking, shouting, etc. Most couples are there, quiet and definitely wanting calm. Families are not encouraged to go there unless you (and your kids) are quiet, or you??™ll have 90% of the people around you staring and despising you for disturbing??¦ Mobile phones are not welcome there, same reaction as above. The beach is private, only Berjaya??™s guests can access it. The water is warm and clean but it is not transparent, rather murky as the sand floats a bit, so there is no snorkelling possible here. No corals anyway. This disappointed me at first, but I forgot about it rather quickly and relaxed. We thought about the Pulau Payar trip but all reviews and experiences made us realise it could be an unpleasant experience, like crowds of hundreds of us cramped on a boat, obeying to x and y comments from organisers like a herd of sheep and not having our own experience of relaxing snorkelling. We went to Koh Tao (Thailand) last year and we did the around-the-island day trip and we were a boat of 5 people, each creek was quiet and we were free. That was worth it. We were quite put off by the Payar details so didn??™t go for it.  About the staff and service: they were great! What needed to be done, it seems, was a good kick in the management??™s butt. And it has happened. During our stay, we met several times with the new Manager of the resort; he is Australian and started his role just 1 week before we arrived. New measures were already in place and during our stay we observed some changes: the beach huts were being renovated, brand new towels were distributed in the rooms and the staff was being monitored. I have to say again that the staff (restaurant, bars, housekeeping, etc) at Berjaya was very friendly. They greet you at any time of the day with a big smile. We could observe that some guests never smiled or didn??™t talk to them nicely. If those kinds of people reviewed on Tripadvisor and said they didn??™t like the service much, then it??™s half their fault. If you show courtesy, are pleasant and respectful, you will be served better and overall have a better time, right?  The spa at the Berjaya is nice, in the jungle but close to the seashore. We had the aromatherapy one for 60 mins, very nice. By booking on site, it costs around 160MR. We had pre-booked our massages when we booked our chalet on Berjaya??™s website so it was less (128MR per person).  Berjaya can offer various activities at a cost (waterskiing is 130MR for 30 mins for example). We didn??™t think it was worth it but it??™s a personal opinion.  We did the cable car to go up the 2nd highest peak of Langkawi, just by the Berjaya??™s entrance ??“ nice views. What you see mostly is the gigantic Geopark Jungle Forest and a tall (but hardly any water) waterfall on your way up. The oriental village seemed OK but we didn??™t wander much. They have a duty free shop so if you want to get beer for 4MR or wine for 40MR, go there. Cigarettes are 50-70MR for a box of 10 packs. Sun cream is also cheaper there.  One clear highlight of our holidays was discovering about the fauna and flora of Langkawi, thanks to Dev??™s Adventure Tours. I will put my review on this site under what to do in Langkawi.  Thanks to the Berjaya??™s location, we could carry on watching the wildlife every day, such as herons fishing right by our chalet, monkeys running around (one black one with crazy eyes charged me one afternoon as I walked back to the chalet. I think he thought I had a fruit in my hand, but didn??™t so he diverted his run at the last second. It was quite scary I have to say). I also saw a rare encounter; Dev the conservationist took a few seconds to believe me. It happened by the Beach restaurant at breakfast time. There was a very loud noise, a cry, not a pleasant one. Most people stopped eating and ventured off to find the source. Then I saw it: a monitor lizard (a very big one!) had caught a flying lemur and had one of his limbs in his mouth. The Lemur was in crucial pain and his cry was unique, sad and very loud??¦ I didn??™t have my camera with me, what a shame! The staff went towards them to separate them. It??™s not a good thing when humans interfere with nature, but really it was painful to watch and hear so I am glad they did it.  Berjaya means Success in Malay. I hope this resort will keep improving ??“ they are definitely doing something about it with a new manager in place.  I recommend the Berjaya for a nice stay in Langkawi, with a preference for a chalet on or very near the water. They are in good conditions and you get more peace. It is not a high luxury resort (like on Datai bay) but it a good quality one, it is very nice, spacious and friendly. I hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.",4,5,105,Berjaya Langkawi Resort - Malaysia,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298283-d307706-Reviews-Berjaya_Langkawi_Resort_Malaysia-Langkawi_Langkawi_District_Kedah.html,Langkawi,6

Issues: the frige-freezer, which was lovely and big, made quite a lot of noise whenever the motor was on; the heat/cool unit is an airconditioner fitted to the wall under the window - it did warm the room up but it was quite a large unit that rather noisily blew air around the room and we had to turn the TV up when the unit was on.

30033,ElizabethChester,Hotels,10/12/2012,A very enjoyable stay,"This is a large and well run hotel with a very good leisure centre. Our bedroom was large with a double and single bed. One lady, who had booked a single room, had a double bed and two single beds. Our room was well furnished, had a window that opened and a distant view of the Menai Straits. Ensure that your key cards are issued at the same time. We were told to return to Reception later for a second card, but then the original card did not work. A second pillow was supplied on request. The mattress was exceedingly firm and the duvet much too hot.  Our group ate in the ballroom, where there was an 8.30 am start for breakfast. One couple, who arrived at 8.15 am, was asked to leave as breakfast was not ready. There was a good choice at the breakfast buffet and hot covered items on the Saturday morning. However, on Sunday morning, the covers had been removed and items were only luke-warm. The bacon was especially good. Staff served tea and coffee from large pots and the tea tasted stewed if you had the dregs. Hot water was brought on request in little pots. At dinner three courses were ordered at the start of the meal. All the waiting on staff worked together as a team, serving each table. Some guests had to ask for certain vegetables, e.g. peas, cauliflour as these were often missing from the serving dishes by the time the last guests were being served. There was a plentiful supply of iced water on the tables.  There are seating areas on each landing well away from the bedrooms and a Pepsi machine on the third floor landing. There is only one lift, so there is often a queue.  The leisure centre has a shaped swimming pool, shallow near the edges and so especially good for children or poor swimmers. Children can use the pool until 6 pm on week days and 5 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. An instructor was shouting instuctions on Friday evening to what sounded like a class of 20 children, but which turned out to be only 2! The jacuzzi uses water from the swimming pool, but the sauna is hot.

Overall, we really enjoyed the Comfort Inn. It is great value compared to other Manhattan hotels of similar standard: the rooms are, by New York standards, comfortably spacious and very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. We were originally given a room with a connecting door to another room, through which we could hear some noise at night. We asked to move the next morning and this was done straight away, with no problem at all.  The location was important to us as we wanted to be downtown and within easy reach of Williamsburg, so the Comfort Inn was absolutely perfect for that. It was fun being in the middle of Chinatown, Little Italy is 4 blocks away and you can be on the Lower East Side, Soho, Wall Street or Greenwich Village in less than 15 minutes&acute; walk. The subway is 2 blocks away if you need to go uptown. We walked across the Williamsburg Bridge and were on Bedford Avenue within an hour of leaving the hotel (it&acute;s also a short subway or cab ride away).  The breakfast is slightly disappointing but not a huge problem when you can walk 5 minutes to Little Italy for a great coffee!  I would certainly recommend the Comfort Inn to people planning a short stay in NYC and aiming to spend most of their time downtown, but not wanting to spend $300+ a night on a hotel.",4,1,101,Comfort Inn Manhattan Bridge,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1383001-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Manhattan_Bridge-New_York_City_New_York.html,New York City,6

By the time I got settled in it was noon and I really had a craving for a bottomless cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast. Where am I going to find breakfast at 12 pm?  Thanks to Yelp I found exactly what I was looking for. This restaurant is at the end of a shopping center so it has two walls of windows - light and bright inside, very clean. Decor is warm and charming. Service was friendly and attentive even though they were very busy (obviously a popular Sunday stop).  I had an omelette that could have fed at least two people and it was stuffed full of meat and veggies, they don&acute;t skimp!

I accept that this is a US/European practice but feels out of place in Australia and left me feeling the check in was impersonal and not really authentic.

The location of the hotel is very good as it sits right on this river and its in the centre of town. There are many interesting bars and restaurants within walking distance along the river bank. I thought the staff were friendly and helpful and I received a warm welcome when checking in. A highlight was the quality and range of food at breakfast - a great way to start the day.

We waited 20 minutes for a window table and sat at the bar that was atmospheric and bustling. We were given a great window table overlooking the street below and the dim lighting and the city buzz outside created a good atmosphere. The menu is extensive and we opted for one of their burgers with additional avocado, one with french fries and the other with salad. The food was tasty and a generous portion. A bottle of Rose wine came in a little expensive but it was drinkable if not memorable. The server was very pleasant indeed. Many other tables opted for a dessert and they looked huge, certainly enough for two if not three - we passed as the burgers were filling enough. If there was one complaint, it is the fact that the air conditioning was pumping out and made the restaurant a little chilly.

13558,Beverley29,Hotels,6/20/2012,Lovely resort in a great location,"We recently stayed here for one week as an exchange through RCI and added on a couple of extra nights which we paid extra for. We were given a huge 2 bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms, 2 kitchens & 3 televisions for 2 of us! This was in a newly renovated block and quite some distance from the main area - reception, lounge, bar, deli, pool etc, but it was beautifully finished. There was another pool nearer to us so that was fine, and plenty of parking spaces. The grounds are well kept, quite a large lake at the back of the resort although we were quite surprised that it had an alligator in it! The main drawback was that they are still renovating and this caused some noise and lorries coming and going - quite early one morning, this wasn&acute;t quite what we wanted for a relaxing break. Also the lifts have a horrible smell of engine oil in them. However the best thing is the location just across the road from Seaworld and we were able to buy tickets from the concierge at a discount and with free shuttle. It was just off International Drive too, good choice of restaurants and stores nearby as well as other attractions, Discovery Cove, Aquatica, Disney World, Universal Studios all very close.

30183,Ellen22,Hotels,9/21/2013,Enjoyable Stay,We recently stayed for a week in this hotel and found it to be very clean and the food was of a high standard. My husband was a bit miffed at having to wear long trousers in the restaurant when female guests were not always dressed suitably. The staff were very friendly mostly except for a receptionist who was a bit surly. We were staying on a Thompson package and the only complaint was that we arrived too late for dinner on the first night and were given a voucher for a meal on the last night. We were due to leave at 6 and therefore could not have dinner and when I asked about lunch she was adamant that it was not possible and that the only option was a picnic which was to be collected at breakfast - I do not think this was a good idea as with the extreme heat and having to carry it around until the afternoon I think it was a health hazard. She said I could ask to collect it later but we decided to eat out instead therefore losing the meal which we had paid for in the package. I think this happens a lot with travel companies and it is something that needs to be looked at. The room was comfortable except for a very hard bed which my husband liked but I found a bit uncomfortable. The bathroom was very clean but the bath had seen better days. The cleaning staff do a fantastic job as do the waiters/chefs in the restaurant. The entertainment was enjoyable especially the comedy Elvis and the flamenco dancers. The live animal shows of birds and snakes were different and provided the chance to see the creatures at close proximity. The pools were immaculate although we are not in the hotel long enough to use them preferring to go on tours to visit other parts of the island and travelling to La Gomera to admire the views and taste the local foods. If we were to visit Tenerife again we would consider booking this hotel as it is in a good area although there are hilly areas all around.,4,2,102,Hilton London Canary Wharf,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d585836-Reviews-Hilton_London_Canary_Wharf-London_England.html,London,6

The check-in was quite quick even though I had no reservations but given the layout of the hotel the room was far away from the lobby reception area.

The room was large and updated with very comfy beds. The bathroom was rather small, but nothing unmanageable. We purchased our room through Priceline and received a very reasonable rate. I would say our only bad experience, had to do with the fact that we stayed only one Saturday night, and the hotel was hosting two wedding receptions that night, which made check-in and car valeting, super frustrating. Once we got to our room, we didn&acute;t notice it too much, but getting out of the main area to go out to dinner was a little frustrating as well.

9577,Atena,Hotels,1/25/2011,Would stay again,"I had mainly booked this hotel because of the very low price and the relatively good comments and did not regret it. I have stayed in H.I. Express hotels before so I knew what to expect. The rooms are pretty similar all over the world. Mine was a bit small (still fine for London) but I was traveling on my own and got used to the size after the first couple of hours. It was clean and functional, exactly what I needed. It&acute;s not a luxury hotel but when you book a hotel room in London for less than 60 pounds you know that. Breakfast was fine. Corn flakes and croissants and a few other items that you find in all H.I. Express hotel and it is of course included in the rate. When the hotel is very busy the breakfast room gets full but there is an additional area to the right of the entrance that guests can use. Staff was fine, did what they could to assist. I had to stay one more day because I got stuck in London during the Volcano Ash fiasco and as others have said, found that the online prices are much better than the ones offered at the desk, but that&acute;s the rule everywhere nowadays. It&acute;s situated in a nice residential area of North London on Finchley Rd right across the street from the tube and with a couple of buses serving to central London as well. It takes about 15min on the tube and about 30min on the bus (always depending on the traffic) to get there. There are 24 hour supermarkets and a few nice eating places as well right across the street.

It is an easy 5 min walk to Finchley Rd tube station which takes you anywhere in London in 15-30 min. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, including a mall across the street with at least 6 restaurants and a grocery store inside. There are 2 pubs across the street too, Australia Bar and Whetherspoons, both nice places for pub food and drinks. A little Kabab restaurant across the street deserves special mention.

I have no complaints about the room and for being such a well known huge hotel in the city it was very quiet. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the elevators.

There were Bose entertainment centers in both rooms and an iPod docking station in one room making it easy to listen to music. The bathroom was a nice size but there was not a separate shower. And there was only a single sink. Water pressure was great. At this price range I expect a separate shower and 2 sinks. Another issue is that a hotel of this caliber should invest in soft-close toilet seats. The club floor amenities were good but not as good as you get at some other hotels. That said it was still a nice club. More and more club floors like this one do not provide alcohol, which is a bit of a bummer.

The hotel is in a great location just a few yards from the Ternes Metro stop and surrounded by numerous restaurants. There is also a monprix supermarket next door. It is about a five to ten minute stroll from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elyses.  The hotel itself is modern in design with reasonably sized rooms (by paris standards). In our room there was a mini bar (expensive), tea and cofee facilities (free), a safe (free), flat screen tv (only 1 english channel), direct dial phone and hairdryer. There are a number of comments on here regarding the bathrooms at this hotel. It is correct that the bathroom is separated from the room by an opaque glass screen but is open (no door), so perhaps not the best if you&acute;re not sharing with a loved one... Having said that, the toilet is separate and fully private. The room was air-conditioned and cleaned daily with fresh towels if requested.  The hotel is set over (I think) 9 floors. There is a lift, but it is small and a bit rickety. As far as the decor was concerned, think IKEA and you are about there. The hotel appeared to be well looked after and was clean, although the decor finish wasn;t anything more than average. The staff we encountered were all polite and spoke good English, although they did seem to be more friendly with French speaking guests. Breakfast was typical continental, but of a good standard with plenty of choice. I have seen comments regarding noise at this hotel, but I didn;t experience any problems either from other guests or the (busy) street outside.  There s a lap dancing club next door to the hotel (Stringfellows) but again, I didn;t experience any problems.

My husband managed to get one of the last rooms in the old part of the Inn at least 5 months before we travelled. We did not know what to expect and were really pleased as we walked into this wonderful old building with its stunning interior. If you go you may never experience anything like this again, so it is worth a visit. The rooms in the old building are quite something but luxury or comfort need to be forgotten. The beds are comfortable and the linens excellent but if you stay you will only have a wash basin in your room with the toilet facilities down the hall (unfortunate if like me you need to pay a visit in the wee small hours) and a shared shower room along the corridor which means you have to take your clothes in with you. The hotel in fairness, provides dressing gowns and the toiletries are good in the shower room and bedrooms, but if you must have a luxury bathroom en-suite this will not suit you at all. We went in June when it was already very hot especially in the small room which required the windows to be open, even at night. No air con of course. The walkway into the hotel went directly passed our window so despite the darkness of the room (no way to put on make-up in the room) as there was only a fly screen and no actual curtains for privacy, we felt a bit exposed. The lighting in the hotel cannot be upgraded so the rooms are very, very dark (take a torch) Our room was also under the wooden staircase which creaked whenever anyone went up or down. The hotel restaurant is fine but nothing amazing and the service is slow because it is full and the staff are obviously asked to be very friendly and chatty with the customers. You need to aware that this evening meal needs to be booked in advance. The bar has an outside area which is great for viewing Old faithful which errupts every 90 minutes and is of course, spectacular. There is also a pianist who plays in the seating areas in the central area of the hotel which is a lovely area to relax in with a drink in the evenings. If you want to walk around the area close to the hotel there is plenty to see, but the best time is early morning when it is cooler. This is an extremely unique hotel and is worth a visit The staff are very good and the rooms and hotel in general very clean. They do have more modern rooms in the rest of the hotel so if you are going for more than one night or are fussy about private facilites, it would probably be best to book one of those well in advance. This is however, an experience not to be missed if you are travelling in Yellowstone.",4,1,100,Old Faithful Inn,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60999-d220121-Reviews-Old_Faithful_Inn-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,Yellowstone National Park,6

The rooms were very nice- modern and comfortabel and although my room layout was a bit quirky, I had a wonderful view of the city. The concierge was fantastic and helped get tickets for tours in the city and they were very responsive with good suggestions for places to eat.  The gym was reasonably adequate, and the pool was more for a dip than a swim.  Internet access was good, but my one complaint was that the restaurant in the hotel is not very good, although there are a number of good restaurants nearby, so this is not an issue, unless you are in a hurry in the morning.

On the first night we were allocated a room on the 9th floor and on the next visit it was the second floor. Both rooms were identical and compact. The bed was very comfortable and we were pleased to have a bath / shower in the bathroom. We had breakfast on the second stay and I have to say it was excellent. There was a very good choice and it was presented and cooked very well - better than a breakfast I had in a 4 star hotel in Glasgow at the end of Feb. This was my first stay at a premier inn and if I needed a hotel at the airport again I would book this one.

18667,Calibrator,Hotels,2/10/2011,Ok if your company is picking up the bill!!,"We&acute;ve stayed here previously and chose the hotel again because it was cheaper than other quality hotels more centrally located in Canary Wharf. This is a nice hotel and has a classy, relaxed feel about it from the moment you arrive. It&acute;s also great to see that the management bother to reply to reviews posted here on tripadvisor. There are some downsides though and if it weren&acute;t for it&acute;s Docklands location I&acute;d have to wonder just what I was paying so much money for. The rooms are not that large, mainly because the bathrooms are huge, and we found them to be quite dark and very stuffy. The bathroom/wet rooms are very nice but do take up a lot of space leaving you with an otherwise average hotel room at this price. The position of the hotel means that there are buildings towering over it on either side which ruins any chance of natural light into the rooms. The views aren&acute;t too good either and because of the hotel&acute;s design, the only chance you will get of a full river/O2 view is from one of the expensive suites located at the front. The hotel&acute;s location is a good walk from the attractions of Canary Wharf and it&acute;s not an area in which I&acute;d feel completely happy wandering around at night on my own. This means a taxi everywhere after dark and in case you think of staying in, I was stunned to be charged over ??13.00 for two drinks in the bar. I&acute;m used to paying London prices for drinks but this is steep even by those standards. To sum up, this is a nice enough hotel catering to the needs of business clients who are very likely not spending their own money. If you&acute;re looking to stay in Docklands purely for leisure then I&acute;d wait for a cheap weekend offer to come up at one of the central Canary Wharf hotels where you&acute;ll have a better choice of places to go within walking distance.

10508,AyrshireBacon,Hotels,12/7/2014,Great Value (Hotwire) and Great Location,"The &acute;Centre&acute; is one of several Rosen Brand hotels in the area so be sure you are indeed booking the right location wit the correct amenities for your stay, some are resorts and the others are exhibition / business class hotels. Other than that, it&acute;s all good(ish).  We arrived from a transatlantic flight surprisingly fresh and were quickly checked into our pre-booked upgraded room on the twenty fourth floor, which was an oversize room on the executive levels with views over SeaWorld and toward Epcot / Disney in the distance. The storage, lighting and bathroom were all more than ample and the bed considerable in size as well as levels of comfort in a well maintained and clean environment.  Yes there are parking charges but most hotels of this type do and at ??36.00 per night via a third party &acute;secret hotel&acute; booking site there are no complaints here, yes the drinks / food in the lobby stores are very expensive but just plan ahead - you are surrounded by shops inc Wallgreens, Dennys, McD&acute;s with the Pointe absolutely stuffed with restaurants and entertainment just a $10.00 black limo ride away (taxi $7 if you are cheap). There&acute;s a pool, pool bar, spa, blah blah - it&acute;s all you need and more.  Ok downsides are indeed the aircon unit which is a pain in the backside being an older and quite noisy unit - it does need updated - and in our room we had no idea there was room service other than finding a leaflet but no menus. It can be noisy and busy due to the conventions etc which are at the hotel rear, you&acute;ll need to walk through that lot to get your car from the multi-level car park which is a fair distance away - if with a less able bodied person drop off / pick up at the door would be suggested. The executive lounge is close to pointless and why I am not giving the hotel an otherwise excellent score, lifeless...  We would however definitely return and still upgrade the room even with no intention of using the lounge, if booked at the discounted rate. It&acute;s only slightly away from the I-Drive &acute;action&acute; but a great option to consider.",4,0,100,Rosen Centre Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34515-d123526-Reviews-Rosen_Centre_Hotel-Orlando_Florida.html,Orlando,6

28557,Dreemz05,Hotels,9/13/2013,Awesome for Shopping!,"Spent 4 nights in Singapore with my husband and had an amazing time!  This hotel is nicely located in the shopping Mecca of Singapore. As soon as you walk out the of the lobby, you arrive into the hustle and bustle of shoppers and commuters alike. The hotel is also one block away from the world famous Ion shopping mall. Another good thing is that it is extremely close to the MRT station, as well as underground air-conditioned access tunnels, so you can actually walk to places underground with out getting a heat stroke!  Apart from being well located, the hotel was clean and modern. The mini bar was complimentary, and many thanks to the person who thought of putting a Nespresso Espresso maker into the rooms!  The breakfast buffett was HUGE,,,but even so after two days or so it got old. I would recommend going to the food court at the basement of the Ion instead. That was the best place to try REAL Singaporean food..it was a delicious fusion of the some of the best Asian cuisine I&acute;ve had. It practically had everything from Dunkin Donuts to live Sri Lankin crabs. And it was much cheaper than the breakfast buffet.  One down side was that alot of the rooms in this hotel were facing a wall, with no view at all. It was alittle depressing opening the curtains every morning and to face nothing but brick. We asked to change rooms after our second night and ended up facing small alley instead...better than nothing I guess.  When we arrived, the hotel was going through construction. However I really was not bothered by the nose and didn&acute;t mind it.

Definitely beat most 4-star hotels in NZ (and some self-rated 5-star places too). Free/affordable wireless internet would have been great - its $13US per 24 hours which is really steep by today&acute;s standards where you tend to expect free wifi. The Buffet offered excellent value and quality breakfast and lunch (which you get a free voucher for SO LONG AS YOU GET THE CLUB CARD, which I forgot to). I enjoyed the limited gambling that I did - only one grumpy looking croupier I guess thinking that a cheap kiwi isn&acute;t going to tip - as the croupiers were friendly and helpful for newbies. Had other family with us for the stay. They enjoyed it too. We played 10-pin and I&acute;m sure the lanes were the best I&acute;ve ever bowled on. All in all I&acute;d have to say 8.5 out of 10!

25537,DarthPaulo,Hotels,2/24/2011,Perfect for our 6 night stay in Sydney,"We wanted an inexpensive no frills hotel for our stay and were very happy here. We arrived early for check in and were allowed to leave our cases in storage and use complimentary showers after our flight. Staff were nice and really helpful. Map provided along with some directions. Our room was a deluxe one on a high floor with a balcony. Very spacious, good shower. There were no drawers to store clothes though which was suprising given the size of the room. The Wifi was terrible and expensive. Location wise easy walk to Surrey Hills where there is an abundance of lovely restaurants that you wouldn&acute;t neccessarily go to if you were staying in the centre of town or Darling Harbour etc. We found some gems and were therefore delighted with the location. You can walk to Hyde Park and Darling Harbour fairly easily - about 10 and 20 mins respectively. Opera House too far in the heat. There are bus stops nearby and liquor stores, Internet cafe and supermarket all on the doorstep. Breakfast here was not great so do not recommend you get it included and instead venture to Bills a few blocks away for the best brekkies ever!

Breakfast buffet had hot and cold foods and was quite good. There were cheese omelettes, sausages, toast, jam, oatmeal, cereals, fresh fruits, yoghurt, muffins, danishes, coffee and juices.

We witnessed four due to dinner and coffee. Afterdinner drinks are of course not an option here. The fountain was beautyful, shooting, spraying and dancing to music of different styles ranging from opera via Michael Jackson to local arabic. Only thing is that each show just lasts one song and then there is a pause for half an hour, though they incresed the frequency towards the ending.

Great free breakfast, and very helpful, caring staff. Only drawbacks are parking is valet and $15 or so and the traffic on Olympic Blvd. was hard to fall asleep to.

As one of the cheapest options in London, I wasn&acute;t expecting much of the room but was pleasantly surprised. It was very small, even for a single room, but fine for a short stay. It was clean and the furnishings weren&acute;t at all bad - I liked the wood panelling around the bed area and the single bed was reasonably comfortable with decent bedding. The window was missing curtains, only having a built-in venetian blind, but at least the window had a fairly open view - I could even see Big Ben in the distance but close enough to tell the time. The shower room was also small but manageable and was tastefully decorated with black marble-effect tiles. I had some gripes in that the water didn&acute;t drain away very quickly from the wash-basin and the reading light above the bed didn&acute;t work, but these were minor. Given the location, I wasn&acute;t expecting it to be a quiet room. There was the inevitable road noise, but with the double-glazed window shut the noise was tolerable. There was also very little noise from neighbouring rooms. I wouldn&acute;t have wanted a room near the lift area though as, apart from the lifts, there was a very noisy vending machine there. I didn&acute;t take breakfast in the hotel as there are various coffee shops dotted up Tottenham Court Road.  Based on location, price and quality, I can recommend the St Giles Hotel and I would stay there again - that is, provided they don&acute;t increase their prices, as ??85 for a small, basic, single room is still on the high side and I certainly wouldn&acute;t pay that in any other British city.",4,2,102,St Giles London - A St Giles Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193113-Reviews-St_Giles_London_A_St_Giles_Hotel-London_England.html,London,8

32178,FY1,Hotels,7/17/2013,Just about a 3 Star hotel,"We had read the mixed reviews about this hotel but arrived prepared to be fair and objective........Oh dear, what a disappointment. This hotel was recommended by Thomson&acute;s Travel Agents out of the Hayes and Jarvis brochure which, quite erroneously, awards it a &acute;4 diamond&acute; rating (one assumes 4 star equivalent). From our arrival to departure we felt as though we were not welcome as guests; instead we felt as though we were being treated as a parcel being processed. The impression was that the hotel system was far more important than the guests staying there.  The good points overall were: Excellent location for a Toronto based holiday; efficient and polite staff; a spacious room; an adequate standard of room cleanliness and an adequately clean bathroom but not of 4 Star standard; plenty of clean towels and hot water with a good shower; clean and comfortable beds and linen changed regularly; good pool and fitness facilities.  Reception, was always busy and, at times, chaotic. Reception staff were efficient and polite but it was as if they had to stick to a script. Given that it&acute;s a big and very busy hotel one would assume that the reception desk would have been adequately manned. The signs behind the reception desk that instructed staff to &acute;Keep Your Station Tidy&acute; instead of &acute;Please Ensure Our Guests&acute; Needs Are Met&acute;, spoke volumes about the management style.  The layout of the lobby was poor and too much was happening in a large area without any sound deadening material. The vast expanses of marble flooring and walls created an overbearingly noisy and stressful environment. Signage to lifts and facilities was very poor, being confusing and difficult to follow.  Regarding the accommodation the bad points were: the overall shabbiness of the room; peeling wallpaper; a balcony door which was nigh on impossible to open; old, noisy and, at times, smelly air-conditioning; no safe or fridge in the room; poor wi-fi connection. All of this was at odds with the Hayes & Jarvis brochure description of &acute;......1500 tastefully appointed rooms.....&acute;. Continuous external noise from the hotel central air-conditioning plant and intrusive noise from the corridors also made this a less than ideal hotel in which to stay. We were lucky in that the guests in the next room (there was an adjoining door) were obviously as considerate as we tried to be.  Having just been taken over by the Eton group, the new management team were certainly in evidence, scrutinising every move the staff made without offering to help out at busy times. Surprisingly though, no manager was available when we wished to discuss our concerns even though we were promised that one would leave a message to arrange a meeting. We??™re still waiting.  The restaurant area is over-priced with cold food of mediocre quality and with a badly organised hot food area serving poorly cooked dishes which are served tepid. Ventilation is very poor with a strong, acrid smell of burned fat.  We enjoyed seeing the sights of Toronto - it was part of a celebratory birthday holiday but, sadly, it was marred by our stay at the Eton Chelsea.",2,1,101,"Chelsea Hotel, Toronto",http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g155019-d183778-Reviews-Chelsea_Hotel_Toronto-Toronto_Ontario.html,Toronto,0

We upgraded to a clubroom because on their website they claim: 24-hour lounge, complimentary drinks and cocktail hour, complimentary buffet breakfast, free morning newspaper delivered to your door, aromatherapy spray, dressing room BEWARE. We were treating our friends for the weekend and I called ahead to verify this (they charge 10p a minute to make reservations if you use the first number they list - 0871 number). I got a sales pitch like never before - that should have made me suspicious. The person confirmed we would have 24-hour access to the lounge which was important to our stay. What a fiasco when we checked in. There were at least 4 receptionists - and us. No professionalism. We requested rooms on separate floors and the body language and mutterings were appalling and embarrassing. They finally sorted that out between three of them. We were immediately told breakfast was not included so would we like to add it to our reservation for ??10 each. I mentioned it was included with the clubroom and I was immediately told it wasn&acute;t until finally they admitted it&acute;s only a continental breakfast"""" - which was fine by us - but also an embarrassing scene. Once receptionist told us the breakfast was served to 9 am (on a Sunday??) and another said 11:30 - my husband questioned the answer and the manager got involved and said it was until 9 am. Who&acute;s ever heard of a 9am Sunday cut off for breakfast? BUT the ??10 breakfast was served until 11:30 - interesting way of making more money. THEN the Canapes and Drinks at 6 pm. They arrived at about 6:08 and there were 12 tiny canapes for the room - which was full at this point (about 16 of us). It was so cramped everyone was bumping into each other trying to get a drink - total chaos and pathetic display of canapes. Nothing was replenished by the time we left at 6:25. When we returned at night to chat and relax in the 24-hour lounge we were told it was closed and we couldn&acute;t use it! Our friends roasted - air conditioner faulty. As another reviewer said - there was one of most of the items in the double club room. In the morning no paper. My husband went to the desk and yet again - an unprofessional response - """"oh - you have to ask for it."""" Another cost-savings - no one asked us. We won&acute;t go back. We ended up paying ??27 extra per room for basically nothing. As far as location - as others said - nothing around unless you want to take a chance in a rough area and listening to planes overhead.

The hotel has completed renovations since last year, but overall still has pretensions beyond the service offered. We arrived at 1230 hoping to check in to our rooms before a family lunch booked for 2pm, but only one was ready. It was made very clear that &acute;check-in is 3pm&acute;, this repeated loudly and emphatically by reception. There was clearly no possibility whatsoever of asking housekeeping to prepare our rooms out of their usual sequence, so we had to leave our bags behind reception until we returned at 6pm. No chance to freshen up after a long drive. It was suggested we should come down for breakfast early if possible to avoid the 9.30 peak as the hotel was full. This prediction was certainly right - from 9.30 to 10.30 there was a permanent queue and this was purely because tables weren&acute;t being cleared as there was insufficient staff! The entire breakfast service was crippled due to lack of low-paid service staff, while suit-wearing more senior staff half-heartedly and slowly cleared a few tables.

I was extremely unhappy to arrive at 1:30 p.m. and find that I had no parking as the lot was full. They advertise as having parking. To me, that means that you have a spot for EVERY room in your hotel. I was instructed to park in a garage a block away. This was very scary as Hollywood Boulevard was a very seedy area with many scary people lurking about. What made it worse was that we had to leave at 4 a.m. to drive back to San Diego to fly home which meant that I had to walk in the pitch black to go get the car. I was scared to death as I walked by people sitting outside at that time at the seedy hotel next door and homeless people on the street. I feel very lucky to be alive and with all of my money. As far as the room, it wasn&acute;t the cleanest but passable. the most basic room I have ever seen, though. Not one thing hung on the walls and like others have said, NO CLOCK. This made me very uncomfortable to rely on a wake up call for our 4 a.m. wake up. We set our cell phones but had never done that before so I was scared to rely on that also. We should have been alarmed that the check in desk is behind what looks like bullet proof glass.

The rooms are adequate, but lack anything much in the way of amenity. Bed, TV, phone and a rack to hang your clothes, a few shelves and a chair and table. No clock, fridge or coffee maker.

I found the elevator cars messy and with lots of spills on the floor. As far as returning here, I guess I would have to say that I would opt for my normal hotel which I really like, but is a little more expensive, about another $20 per night. Point being take the more expensive hotel and leave this in your rear view mirror.  Lastly, I found the hotel rooms to be noisy to the outside. I could hear the trucks and buses from the outside. Again, something that I find to be unacceptable especially since I have to be up at 5:30 am for work.",2,2,102,Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60982-d214683-Reviews-Waikiki_Beach_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,Honolulu,3

I was already familiar with the story before visiting, so I was hoping to get a feel for the rooms that the family hid in for so long. I did see them, but shuffling through in a slow moving line of other visitors meant that it was difficult to visualise how the rooms would have been.  It didn??™t help that all of the rooms are bare and unfurnished. Anne??™s father decided that this is how they should be exhibited, for symbolic reasons. To be fair, the place is so small that it would be difficult to allow visitors to pass through if it was furnished, but it does mean you are just visiting a set of empty and bare rooms.  We pre-booked a visit time and went at 7pm, so we walked straight in without queuing.

Close to Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood Bowl, Universal Studios etc. Rooms are very clean. Reasonable rates. Comfortable beds. Fantastic showers. Free parking.  The bad: The hotel layout is more like a motel, so be prepared for people walking up and down outside your window. Our TV didn&acute;t work. It simply wouldn&acute;t switch on. The fridge is so noisy we had to unplug it. Air conditioning is good, but noisy.  And now for the most frustrating part... The Internet access. This may not be a big problem for many, but as we both had work to do while traveling, it was a huge issue for us. There is free wifi, but it is TERRIBLE. You can browse very slowly, but if you have to upload or download even the tiniest document, it struggles to a halt. It took me four hours to upload a 55kb document, no exaggeration. Free wifi is not an excuse for poor wifi. They have a computer in the reception area for guest use, but it&acute;s using the same crappy Internet connection. It took us over 45 minutes to book and print 2 tickets for universal studios because the connection was so bad. Even more frustrating... If you go to the bar or lobby of the hotel next door, the Hollywood Heights, you get super fast free wifi. We ended up in there most evenings just so we could get our work emails answered.  If I had no need for Internet, I would mark this hotel 4 outta 5.

We stayed at BLVD for couple days and think that the hotel is a decent stay for under $150 range. The king room is large with a king bed, a leather sofa, a desk with executive chair and couple cube leather ottomans chair and a ottomans bench. The leather sofa is good for sitting but not for sleeping in if you&acute;re wonder. There is a nice refrigerator and a microwave which is a plus for family travel. the TV is nice and plenty of channels to choose from (have your own DirectTV control box in the room) and the room has plenty of storage spaces. Now the BAD from this hotel! we had the freeway facing room and it is noisy even with the double pane window! We turn the fan on all night to create to white noise so we can sleep. The floor is laminate flooring so it is noisy when someone walking at night. Parking is tight, and most of them are double park so if you got one of those spot, you need to give the front desk your car key so they can move the cars around so people can get out. The parking is lighted and watch by the front desk employees (security camera?) and it cost $17 per day. The pool is very small and indoor, we didn&acute;t bother to try it out. There is no safe in the room which is another minus for us. Overall, it is a decent hotel consider the price range, but if you&acute;re light sleeper look somewhere else or bring earplugs! PS.

Our 2 year old is currently obsessed with trains so the model train set (under construction) and multiple train rides made the Fairmont a paradise for him! Rooms are nothing to write home about but clean and comfortable with requests (cot, rooms close to other family) satisfied. Breakfast was so so (a bit of a cafeteria feel!) but great views from the restaurant. Did not eat at embers but they catered the wedding and we were impressed.

There was someone already in the room they had assigned me so i had to go back to reception to see about another one, was assigned another room along the same corridor. At least this room was vacant, but it was like stepping back in time to the 80&acute;s going into the room, there was an old green leather chair, nasty striped carpet, dated curtains and the tv was really old and the reception on the channels kept cutting out. The telephone didnt work either, checked the cable and it was plugged in just dead though, had to phone from my mobile to the hotel to ask for an iron and ironing board. The bed was really soft and the security chain on the door was also broken.  The bathroom was in serious need of upgrading, broken tiles on the floor and all discoloured round the bath. I didnt eat in the hotel so cant comment on the restaurant.  When reading other tripadvisor reviews, it does seem they have some nicer updated rooms, so looks like I was very unlucky, but this stay didnt leave a good impression and I wont be returning when in the area again.

That being said - when you have to leave the hotel with your bags, be sure to plan for a long elevator wait to avoid undue stress. If you are staying on the lower floors of the hotel, think about the stairs. Waiting for 20 - 30 minutes to be able to get onto an elevator with your luggage was not uncommon in the mornings , when some guests were also busy checking out or heading out to enjoy their day in NYC.

The hotel itself is right next to Camden Lock and just across the road from Wagamamas. Our room was clean, but seemed dingy. Looked out onto the side street so not much of a view, but not too much of a problem as we were out most of the time. I had forgotten to pack my shampoo and conditioner but assumed that the complimentary toiletries would resolve this as pretty much every hotel I have ever stayed in has a generous supply of items that you usually never need. Just my luck then that in the bathroom there were only two small bars of soap, one small shampoo and one small shower gel. The hotel info folder says toiletries can be bought from reception, but they had no hair conditioner . There were no biscuits on the hospitality tray and only 2 teabags.

All three nights we stayed at this property we were woken up by noisy neighbors, or very chatty housekeepers in the hall. Insist on a non-connecting room if you must stay at this property. It is a convention hotel, however that does not excuse their poor performance. I brought these complaints to managements attention as they took place, and while they did not dispute any of my observations they did comp a night and a lunch, however I was not looking to negotiate a deal. On the basis of meeting basic requirements, that being a clean, noise free, functional facility, they failed to meet the standards. I tried several times to talk directly to the manager Patrick Donelly, and he would not take or return my call. This property plays the odds on receiving multiple complaints and in all honesty I do not believe they really care.

I had to speak to the reception and find the person who checked us in then they apologized and allowed him in.

Another issue was that when I reserved the suite through IPrefer website it mentioned that I was allowed to access the executive lounge and that the minibar inside the room was free of charge but when I checked in they said that they have allocated a slightly bigger suite for me and so they will not allow me to use the executive lounge and I have to pay for the mini bar use!!!! And they called that an Upgrade!!!

The reception area didn&acute;t exactly provide a cheery welcome and the narrow staircase (in need of a new stair carpet) also didn&acute;t inspire confidence.  My single room wasn&acute;t much better and I have rarely stayed in such a small room. In terms of furnishings, it was VERY basic - there wasn&acute;t even a bedside table, and the light over the bed didn&acute;t work. There was only one pillow on the bed but I was glad to find an extra pillow in the wardrobe, as well as a blanket (which I didn&acute;t need since the room was warm enough). Tea and coffee facilities with butter biscuits were provided, so there was some thought there. The ensuite bathroom was also extremely compact, but did have a window. Navigating the bathroom needed some care, as there were two steps inside - a small one up to the basin and then a large one up to the shower. It look me a little while to realise that the toilet flush was above my head, as there was no sign. However, I was pleased to see both a soap bar and liquid soap provided, and hot water seemed plentiful. The bed wasn&acute;t very comfortable - perhaps a little hard for me, plus the duvet barely covered it. I had a poor night&acute;s sleep, mainly due to the very creaky floors and the occupants of the room above moving around until about 2 &acute;o&acute;clock in the morning.  Although breakfast seemed very reasonably priced, I didn&acute;t take it as the hotel is within a few minutes&acute; walk of Hammersmith centre. I returned from breakfast to find the cleaning staff congregating on the stairs near my room - they were pleasant but their presence added further to the claustrophobic feel of this hotel.

Service also tends to poor with unacceptable delays between courses,2,17,117,Cross Foxes Bar & Grill,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1785070-d1917459-Reviews-Cross_Foxes_Bar_Grill-Brithdir_Dolgellau_Snowdonia_National_Park_North_Wales_Wal.html,Brithdir,8

11846,Bangkokexpat,Hotels,8/3/2011,Mediocre But Serviceable,"I stay at La Quinta Inn in Clifton, NJ, when I visit my daughter, because it is the only hotel near her home. This visit was my third or fourth.  The Clifton La Quinta Inn is mediocre at best, but serviceable. It caters to bus tours, mostly of very polite and well-behaved Asians, who descend on it nightly and fill up the property. Unfortunately, the staff is barely able to cope. The front desk telephone went unanswered when I called, and the front desk personnel, with one lovely young lady as an exception, are perfunctory. The nice touch of having hot coffee and tea available in the lobby 24 hours a day, was removed since my visit one year ago. Cheap is cheap.  The breakfast room is a disaster area. It offers a very nice selection of food, but one morning it looked like a trash bin, and no one cleaned the tables for the 30 minutes I was there. On other mornings, while not filthy, it was simply dirty. The management fails to provide a sufficient number of chairs, so that a frequent sight is empty tables without chairs, while guests stand around waiting for others to vacate their seats.  The property is faded and well on its way to being rundown. The carpeting in the public areas is dirty and the upholstered furniture in my room was stained. The desk in my room was chipped, and the plug meant for the computer was inoperable. The ice machine on my floor was broken. However, the wi-fi Internet connection was very good and easy to use. The staff does a good job of surface cleaning, but this property needs a lot more than routine daily cleaning.  Keeping in mind that La Quinta has raised its prices recently and is in no sense cheap, there are other similar chains that do a much better job. Holiday Inn Express comes to mind.",3,0,100,La Quinta Inn & Suites Clifton,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g46365-d98345-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_Suites_Clifton-Clifton_New_Jersey.html,Clifton,8
18817,CameliaMumbai,Hotels,8/26/2010,A 3 star hotel in central London but inconveniently located for public transport.,We stayed for 4 nights at the hotel. The room was quite small and with the bare minimum. There were no toileteries in the bathroom other than liquid soap. So it is a very basic hotel. The breakfast spread was ok but the service in the restaurant at breakfast time was pretty good. The hotel is located in central London but the tube station is quite a distance away so to carry our luggage all the way was quite difficult.,3,1,100,Lancaster Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195206-Reviews-Lancaster_Gate_Hotel-London_England.html,London,8

26120,DawnD57,Hotels,2/15/2012,Not a great place.,"I stayed here one night. I had ordered a King size bed smoking room. I got the smoking room, but no King sized bed. It was two doubles. Not a big deal, I was alone. The room was in the back of the hotel. I thought that Quality Inns had indoor entrances to their rooms. This one did not. When I am traveling alone, I like to have my door on an inside hallway. I didn&acute;t try their breakfast, but the front desk and breakfast area was absolutely tiny. Maybe three very small tables. There was no coffee or anything available in the afternoon, when I checked in. This was a VERY basic hotel. No real amenities or decor. The front desk check in was fine, the lady was helpful. My biggest complaint was that it is in the middle of nowhere. Nothing is far away, but it is very isolated. Drink vending machine was working when I was there and the pool liked nice. Didn&acute;t seem all that clean, and the bathroom is really not big enough to put clothes on after showering. All I can say is meh"""". Go a mile down the road and there are much nicer places.""""",2,1,100,Quality Inn & Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32147-d76289-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Suites-Camarillo_California.html,Camarillo,8
18254,CRobDerbyshire,Hotels,9/19/2007,Basic but good value,"This was one of my cheapest accommodation options for my one-night stay in central London in August 2007. The hotel is very handy for Paddington Station, which provides excellent underground links to the rest of London. I arrived before the normal check-in time, but the friendly reception staff still allowed me to check in. The walk from reception to my room (via the lift) was long and convoluted - not ideal for old people or if carrying heavy luggage. The single room was very small, possibly the smallest I&acute;ve ever stayed in, but there was an en-suite shower room with toilet and basin. The furnishings were basic and in some cases cheap, and the room was not super-clean. The window overlooked a pleasant square at the rear of the hotel. The room was adequate for one night, especially considering I spent very little time in it. Breakfast was included in the price, but on entering the breakfast room I was told to wait outside. However, it was a short wait, and the dining room was pleasant and the breakfast was fine. On the whole, this hotel was acceptable for a short stay, and good value when compared with other central London hotels. I would probably stay there again.",3,3,103,Royal Norfolk Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d192080-Reviews-Royal_Norfolk_Hotel-London_England.html,London,8

It??™s near upscale shopping and the cable cars pass right in front. The staff was terrific but suite looked run down ??“ there was a missing shelf in the bathroom and the toilet is an instructional model with a deafening flush.

12678,Bearable1,Hotels,7/15/2009,"Filthy, dated and mile away from nearest tube","I have stayed in many travelodges and this is the worst by far. The lodge looks like it was converted from an old hotel. The location is poor, at least 20 minutes from the nearest tube station. The room was dirty, the carpet unhoovered, the beds past their sell by dates, but it was the bathrooms that made us sick. If you like showered in other peoples public hairs, this is the place for you. The ceiling was covered in black mould, the shower head covered in red mould, and mounds of dirt in every nook at cranny of the bathroom. There was even a used toothpick left on the sink when we arrived, which we refused to pick up and remained there during our 3 day stay. Just stay away from here, it is horrible.",1,1,101,Travelodge London Farringdon,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193095-Reviews-Travelodge_London_Farringdon-London_England.html,London,8
